Predominantly Persian-speaking in a region where most people speak Arabic, overwhelmingly Shiite where most are Sunni, it has been crippled by Western sanctions meant to make it a pariah. Yet Iran has succeeded in projecting its military power across a large swath of the Middle East. Its reach equals — if not eclipses — that of traditional power centers like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. And now, spurred by the war in the Gaza Strip, armed groups that Iran has fostered over the past 45 years have mobilized simultaneously toward similar goals: diminishing Israeli power and confronting its closest ally, the United States. Iran has tried to capitalize on its outsider position by seeking out disempowered Shiite populations and offering to train and arm them, and by working with the sympathetic government of Syria. The shadow war between Israel and Iran broke into the open this week, when Israel struck an Iranian Embassy compound in Syria and  , renewing fears of a broader conflict. Iran has promised to retaliate, but the  : The Iranians want to avoid igniting a full-fledged war that might drag in the United States and threaten the survival of Iran’s regime. Altogether, Iran now supports more than 20 groups in the Middle East, directly or indirectly, with a combination of  . The United States has designated them as foreign terrorist organizations, and many of their leaders have been hit by sanctions, as has Tehran. While they are often lumped together, and they do in fact share many of Iran’s goals, these groups also have some purely local interests. And, with a few exceptions, Iran does not completely control them. Here is a look at the most prominent of the armed groups backed by Iran. A close ally, it gives Tehran a direct link to the Palestinian struggle, a cause that resonates across the Arab world.

On Oct. 7, Hamas invaded Israel from Gaza, killing roughly 1,200 people, including women and children, according to Israeli authorities, and taking more than 200 hostages.    Since its creation in 1987, Hamas has launched numerous strikes on Israel, often working with another Iranian-backed militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In 2021, the two groups fired     U.S. officials do not believe that Iran initiated the Hamas attack or that it had even been informed about it in advance.    But Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad together receive more than $100 million a year from Tehran in addition to weapons and training, according to a 2020 U.S. State Department  . In a 2022  , Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said Hamas received about $70 million a year.    Iran has not just provided weapons and training to both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, it has also taught Hamas to make and assemble its own weapons from local  .      Although Hamas and other Palestinian groups follow the Sunni branch of Islam and have a different political orientation from Iran, they share antagonism for Israel and anger over the legacy of Western colonialism.    Iran’s outreach to Hamas began in Lebanon in the early 1990s after Israel forced hundreds of Palestinians, including Hamas leaders, to go there. In Lebanon, Hamas adherents quickly forged ties with members of another militia, Hezbollah, Shiite Muslims whose links to Iran were already well established. Through Hezbollah, Hamas became connected to Iran.    At times, however, that relationship has ruptured.    During the Arab Spring of 2011, Hamas backed the anti-government forces in Syria while Iran backed President Bashar al-Assad. And in 2015, Hamas leaned toward   against the   forces in Yemen favored by Iran.    But since then, there has been a   both between the Hamas leadership and  , and between Hamas and the Houthis.    For the most part, Hamas is equipped with comparatively unsophisticated weapons — but quantity makes up for what the group’s arsenal lacks in quality.    Before the war Hamas had thousands of short-range and medium-range rockets that can   at least 125 miles. From Gaza, some of them can reach as far as the Israeli cities of Eilat and Haifa, as well as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.      It also has a large number of   missiles, which the group has used against Israeli troops in Gaza in recent months, according to weapon experts. And it has drones that it has used to attack Israeli tanks and communication nodes.    Within Gaza, Hamas has the ability to manufacture and assemble at least some of these weapons, using parts from Iran, as well as from China and Russia. It is not clear if those countries supplied them or if they were obtained through Iran and Hezbollah.    The largest, oldest and best-trained Iranian proxy group in the Middle East.

Hezbollah, a longtime antagonist of Israel’s, began turning up the pressure on Israel’s border after the war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, launching strikes across the border. Israel has counterattacked, and many civilians on both sides of the border have been forced to flee their homes.    The most sustained conflict between Hezbollah and Israel was in 2006. That fight made clear how formidable Hezbollah forces had become, but it took a deep toll on the Lebanese,  , mostly civilians, and displacing  .    Hezbollah receives significant financial support from Iran, though the exact amount is hard to ascertain. One U.S. official testifying   put the amount at $700 million, but offered no evidence for that number. However, Iran’s cash support for Hezbollah   over time, reflecting the impact of long-term sanctions coupled with the more recent intense sanctions ordered by President Donald J. Trump and maintained by President Biden.    Iran has nevertheless been able to   its backing for Hezbollah in many other ways. It continues, for example, to provide not just arms but also  know-how so that Hezbollah engineers can   weapons locally. The ability to produce its own weapons has made Hezbollah into one of the best-supplied militias in the Middle East.      Experts on Iranian military strategy say that Tehran views Hezbollah forces in Lebanon as its first line of defense should Israel attack Iran.    Iran’s ties to Hezbollah date to Lebanon’s 15-year civil war, which started in 1975. By 1980, Lebanese Shiite Muslims, inspired in part by Iran, had begun an armed struggle against the Israeli military presence in southern Lebanon.    There were many reasons for Iran to aid the fighters, analysts say, but one big one was that doing so presented an opportunity for it to insert itself back into the political fabric of the Arab Middle East. A war with Iraq had left it cut off from much of the region, and especially from Sunni Muslim rulers wary of Iranian leaders.    Estimates by the U.S. military and arms     Hezbollah’s arsenal, the largest of the Iranian-linked groups, at about 135,000 to 150,000 rockets and missiles. Others estimate it is  . With ranges of up to 200 or so miles, they allow the militants to reach targets deep inside Israel.    Among the weapons,  , are between 100 to 400 recently retrofitted missiles with precision-guidance systems that can be programmed to land within meters of their targets. The technology is predominantly Iranian and Russian, though it is sometimes modified by Hezbollah’s weapon experts.    Military analysts view Hezbollah’s fighting force as more disciplined, better trained and better organized than most Middle East armies. It is made up of about   and 20,000 reservists. And, according to analysts, it has the ability to quickly recruit and train thousands of new foot soldiers through its role as a political power and a social-service provider in many Lebanese communities.    A recent addition to Iran’s network of allies, these militants have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route.

They now   about a third of the country, home to 70 to 80 percent of the population, according to U.S. officials.    A Houthi attack on March 6 in the Red Sea  , wounded four others and damaged their Barbados-flagged cargo ship so badly that it sank. Other Houthi strikes have targeted vessels owned by Britain and Greece.    Since the war in Gaza broke out, the Houthis, expressing solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, have launched more than 60 missile and drone strikes on ships transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since the day the war in Gaza began, according to the  .      The attacks have affected commerce worldwide. Shipping through the Red Sea and Suez Canal has dropped at least 50 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some industry analysts say the decrease is closer to 80 percent.    Ports in southern Mediterranean countries are feeling the losses most acutely. Houthi missiles have also targeted Israel’s southern port of Eilat.    Before the war, the Houthis attacked targets in the   and in  .    For the most part, the Houthis receive weapons and training from Iran instead of direct financial support, but   they have also received narcotics, and, in the past,  some petroleum products, both of which can be resold, giving the Houthis needed cash.  In December 2023, the U.S. Treasury   on individuals and on money exchanges in Iran, Turkey and Yemen that were involved in transferring millions of dollars from Iran to the Houthis.    The Houthis share Iran’s adherence to Shiite Islam as well as its antipathy for Saudi Arabia. During Yemen’s  , Iran and Hezbollah   the Houthis fight against both the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers.    Estimates vary widely on the Houthi militia’s manpower and the size of its arsenal.    Experts say it has about 20,000 trained fighters, but in interviews, Houthi leaders have claimed to have as many as 200,000, and in 2015 the United Nations put the number at about 75,000.    What is clear, based on the recent attacks, is that the Houthis have some highly trained units adept at operating increasingly sophisticated drones as well as anti-ship ballistic missiles and missiles intended for stationary targets on land.      Most of the anti-ship missiles and drones have been intercepted by U.S. or British warships or have fallen into the sea without doing damage.    But the Houthis have hit their targets often enough to increase risks and insurance costs, leading many major shippers to avoid the Red Sea route. Container traffic through the Red Sea has  . That has meant a noticeable reduction in business at some European ports.    The European shipping giants  , based in Denmark, and Hapag-Lloyd, based in Germany, are routing most of their loads around the Cape of Good Hope despite the added delivery time and cost. Those companies continuing to thread their way through the Red Sea are relying primarily on U.S. and European navies for protection.    According to a recent   and a  , many of the Houthis’ weapons are either Iranian or variations on Iranian models. They have used ballistic and cruise missiles to hit targets in southern Israel, more than 1,000 miles away.    Most recently, the Houthis have deployed sea drones, some that skim the water and others that travel under the surface. The   are considered to be   weaponry, according to Western intelligence analysts and the U.S. Naval Institute.    Iran has secured far-reaching influence on its neighbor and is a power both in Iraqi politics and in business across most of the country.

While they are less known than Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, they have been just as determined to strike U.S. targets.    Four in particular have had a hand in a number of the attacks in recent years: Kata’ib Hezbollah (which is unrelated to Hezbollah in Lebanon), Harakat al Nujaba, Kata’ib Sayyid al Shuhada and Asa’ib Ahl al Haq.    As war flared in Gaza in October, two of those groups turned up their strikes on American positions in Iraq. Kata’ib Hezbollah and Harakat al Nujaba launched 166 attacks on U.S. military installations in Iraq and Syria, according to a Pentagon spokesman.    The early attacks wounded about 70 troops, with most of the injuries relatively minor. On Jan. 28, however, a strike on a resupply base on the Jordanian-Syrian border   and wounded more than 34.    The Iraqi groups’ links to Iran go back almost two decades, and over the years Tehran has given them money, weapons and training.    Today, Iran still provides training and weapon parts as well as technical and strategic support. The Shiite groups, however, are now part of the Iraqi government’s security apparatus under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces, which includes more than 35 armed groups. The Iraqi government covers the salaries of most of the rank and file. It is unclear if Iran augments the salaries for commanders and the groups’ leadership.      Iran is believed not to dictate the groups’ targets or the timing of their attacks, but it does have some sway in persuading them to hold fire.    That is what happened after the deadly strike on the U.S. resupply base in January. Iran reportedly put   on the groups in Iraq to halt their strikes on U.S. camps and installations. The groups reluctantly agreed, although some continued to carry out occasional attacks in  .    Kata’ib Hezbollah, which analysts   has between 10,000 and 30,000 fighters, uses drones, rockets and missiles with ranges of up to about 700 miles, according to the U.S. Central Command.    With Iran’s help, the group has   the capacity to retrofit missiles to make them more accurate. It also has a variety of attack drones, including ones that can travel up to 450 miles. A drone   in the attack on the resupply base that killed three American troops.    Harakat al Nujaba and Kata’ib Sayyid al Shuhada have fewer troops — analysts estimate their troop numbers are closer to 1,000 to 5,000 — but use similar weapons. They operate primarily in Syria and have attacked Israel.    Nowhere has Iran given more resources to a regional government than Syria, which has been at war for over a decade.

In contrast to Lebanon, where Iran has focused its efforts on a nonstate armed entity, in Syria the support has gone to both government and nongovernmental armed actors.    Two are proxy groups made up of recruited in Iran and  by the Quds Force, the external military and intelligence service of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Others are local forces made up of fellow Shiite Muslims, of Sunnis or of a mix of the Sunni, Shiite, Alawite and Christian faiths.    Iran has helped prop up President Bashar al-Assad in numerous ways, including through   to the government, supplies of discounted oil and payments to help sustain Syria’s military forces.    The Revolutionary Guards also field at least two militias in Syria: the Fatemiyoun brigade, made up of Afghan refugees, and the Zainebiyoun brigade, made up of Pakistani refugees. They reportedly pay other armed contingents more modest salaries.    Iran’s involvement in Syria goes back to just after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when Syria supported the new government in Tehran as others shunned it. Iran sees Syria as a strategic partner offering it overland access to Hezbollah in Lebanon.    Syria is also where Iranian-backed forces retrofit, manufacture and store weapons that Iran then distributes to armed groups in Syria and around the region, above all Hezbollah. Over the past 12 to 15 years, at Iran’s behest, the Syrian government has   some of its   into production centers for retrofitting midrange rockets and missiles with precision-guidance systems, according to Israeli defense and intelligence reports.    The existence of these sites, some of which are underground for protection, became public in 2022 when an Israeli defense minister, Benny Gantz, spoke out about them after Israel bombed Syria and the strikes set off secondary explosions. The United States has also   Iranian weapon stores in Syria.    Syria also has a history of chemical-weapon production dating to the 1970s and of short- and midrange missiles   for their delivery, according to French intelligence officials. In 2023, the U.N. Security Council concluded that Syria still had chemical-weapon stores despite numerous international efforts to compel the government to destroy them.

Kata’ib Hezbollah, which analysts   has between 10,000 and 30,000 fighters, uses drones, rockets and missiles with ranges of up to about 700 miles, according to the U.S. Central Command.    With Iran’s help, the group has   the capacity to retrofit missiles to make them more accurate. It also has a variety of attack drones, including ones that can travel up to 450 miles. A drone   in the attack on the resupply base that killed three American troops.    Harakat al Nujaba and Kata’ib Sayyid al Shuhada have fewer troops — analysts estimate their troop numbers are closer to 1,000 to 5,000 — but use similar weapons. They operate primarily in Syria and have attacked Israel.    Nowhere has Iran given more resources to a regional government than Syria, which has been at war for over a decade.

In contrast to Lebanon, where Iran has focused its efforts on a nonstate armed entity, in Syria the support has gone to both government and nongovernmental armed actors.    Two are proxy groups made up of recruited in Iran and  by the Quds Force, the external military and intelligence service of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Others are local forces made up of fellow Shiite Muslims, of Sunnis or of a mix of the Sunni, Shiite, Alawite and Christian faiths.    Iran has helped prop up President Bashar al-Assad in numerous ways, including through   to the government, supplies of discounted oil and payments to help sustain Syria’s military forces.    The Revolutionary Guards also field at least two militias in Syria: the Fatemiyoun brigade, made up of Afghan refugees, and the Zainebiyoun brigade, made up of Pakistani refugees. They reportedly pay other armed contingents more modest salaries.    Iran’s involvement in Syria goes back to just after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when Syria supported the new government in Tehran as others shunned it. Iran sees Syria as a strategic partner offering it overland access to Hezbollah in Lebanon.    Syria is also where Iranian-backed forces retrofit, manufacture and store weapons that Iran then distributes to armed groups in Syria and around the region, above all Hezbollah. Over the past 12 to 15 years, at Iran’s behest, the Syrian government has   some of its   into production centers for retrofitting midrange rockets and missiles with precision-guidance systems, according to Israeli defense and intelligence reports.    The existence of these sites, some of which are underground for protection, became public in 2022 when an Israeli defense minister, Benny Gantz, spoke out about them after Israel bombed Syria and the strikes set off secondary explosions. The United States has also   Iranian weapon stores in Syria.    Syria also has a history of chemical-weapon production dating to the 1970s and of short- and midrange missiles   for their delivery, according to French intelligence officials. In 2023, the U.N. Security Council concluded that Syria still had chemical-weapon stores despite numerous international efforts to compel the government to destroy them.

Arrests Expose Rift Between N.Y.P.D. and ‘Violence Interrupters’,"Advertisement Supported by An outreach worker trained to intervene in street conflicts was hospitalized after he and a colleague were arrested amid an altercation with the police.  and  For years, New York City has employed a two-pronged approach to reducing gun violence, relying on the police and on the publicly funded conflict mediators known as violence interrupters, who try to defuse disputes before they escalate, including into gunfire.  But the February arrests of two interrupters has caused simmering tensions with the police to boil over and threatens to undermine a key part of Mayor Eric Adams’s approach to curbing shootings and murders. The two sides share a fundamental goal, despite their strikingly different methods. Where officers have the power to arrest, interrupters, often former gang members who in some cases have served prison time, rely on street credibility to steer people from crime. Over the past year, though, interrupters say officers have cursed at them; shoved them out of the way when they tried to break up fights; and arrested them for minor offenses. Then, on Feb. 9, two members of Save Our Streets, a longtime anti-violence group in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights section, said officers had handcuffed them after they tried to calm a man being detained for drug possession. At the time, the two, Mark Johnson and his supervisor, Dequann Stanley, were wearing clothing that identified them as outreach workers. Still, a swarm of officers dragged them to the ground, according to video of the arrests reviewed by The Times, with some punching and kicking Mr. Stanley. “I just felt so helpless,” he said in an interview. transcript “It’s all right. Calm down. Calm down.” “That’s it. Calm down, man.” “Calm down. Y’all running for nothing. Calm down.” Mr. Stanley sustained a gash on his forehead and bruised ribs and spent hours with his ankle shackled to a hospital gurney. He and Mr. Johnson received summonses for disorderly conduct that were later dismissed. They have indicated in court documents filed by their lawyer, M.K. Kaishian, that they plan to sue the city. Since December, two other interrupters have notified the city of their plans to sue over what they say were false arrests stemming from other encounters. The arrests and ensuing fallout pose a challenge to  , which leans heavily on expanding the use of interrupters, a community-based supplement to traditional policing that has taken root in other major U.S. cities. Although studies indicate the presence of interrupters can help reduce crime and gun violence, some rank-and-file officers are less accepting of their presence. The resistance, policing experts said, arises from suspicions about the criminal records of some outreach workers, including some who have been  . “Some of the most effective violence interrupters aren’t far removed from the violence,” said Brandon del Pozo, an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University and a former New York Police Department precinct commander. “Their commitment to ending it is what makes them valuable. But that also is viewed with skepticism.” The Police Department declined to comment on the arrests or on its interactions with interrupters more broadly, and also declined requests for officers’ body camera footage of the Feb. 9 altercation, citing the pending litigation. The confrontation involving Mr. Johnson and Mr. Stanley shook members of other interrupter groups, which operate under  . The system, a network of programs geared toward reducing gun violence, is independent of the Police Department and run by the Department of Youth and Community Development. Less than a week after Mr. Stanley and Mr. Johnson were arrested, some police leaders tried to mend the relationship at a meeting with dozens of interrupters. The gathering was arranged to discuss dealing with potential violence over the summer. Some outreach workers who attended expressed disappointment that officials did not apologize for the arrests of Mr. Stanley and Mr. Johnson. Courtney Bryan, the executive director of the Center for Justice Innovation, which runs Save Our Streets, said in a statement that her organization had met with the police and city leaders about the arrests “to ensure our staff and all violence interrupters are treated as the indispensable, skilled partners they are.” City officials plan additional meetings between the two sides, more funding for violence-interruption programs and training for the police and outreach workers “to form better partnerships,” a spokeswoman for Mr. Adams said in a statement. “This vital work will produce the best outcomes if our officers and violence interrupters continue to work together,” the spokeswoman, Kayla Mamelak, said. Interrupters said they were not sure why tensions with the police had increased, but many believe officers have become more aggressive amid the “defund the police” movement and other calls for criminal justice reform. “I don’t think the rank and file get it,” said A.U. Hogan, whose title is chief of streets at Life Camp, a Queens anti-violence group. “A lot of them are threatened by the work we do.” The Police Benevolent Association, which represents rank-and-file officers, declined to comment. Privately, officers say some interrupters interfere with arrests, attracting crowds and increasing tension on the streets. Officers see themselves as the “legal arm of the government that is supposed to confront violence,” while violence interrupters are supposed to work more “upstream” to prevent violence, said Ian Adams, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina’s Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice and a former police officer in Utah. In the heat of the moment, it can be difficult for officers to discern who is who in a scene, Professor Adams said. “While there’s something active going on right now, that’s going to be the police’s role,” he said. “And if they’re perceiving that as interference, then, from a policy perspective, we have to figure out where these groups belong and where their appropriate place is.” Conflicts between the police and interrupters also emerge when interrupters are charged with crimes. Michael Rodriguez, the former director of Bronx Rises Against Violence, an anti-violence program, was indicted in Orange County, N.Y., last year on charges that included gun and cocaine possession. Kenneth Corey, a former chief of the New York Police Department, said that when he was the commander of a Staten Island precinct from 2018 to 2020, shootings fell 50 percent in a year. He credited the drop in large part to violence interrupters. Generally speaking, he said, some tension stems from officers expecting interrupters to act as informers, and then becoming frustrated when they do not share information. “Police don’t really understand what violence interrupters do,” Mr. Corey, who retired in 2022, said. Tiffany Burgess, an outreach worker with the Brooklyn group Brownsville In Violence Out, filed a claim against the city after she was charged with disorderly conduct in November. On the night in question, she said, she went to a barbershop after work and was there with other neighborhood residents when the police came in. Officers accused the crowd of smoking, drinking and gambling with dice, and demanded identification, according to her court filing. Ms. Burgess, who was wearing her work identification badge at the time, was arrested after declining to provide a state-issued ID. She was held at the precinct for more than an hour, her wrists and ankles shackled. The charge was later dismissed. The police, she said, “don’t care for us to be in the neighborhood.”  “We’re not trying to be police officers,” she said. “We’re trying to get the crime rate down. We’re trying to help them.” The violence-interrupter concept took its current form in New York in 2014, when Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council formed   to organize interrupter groups. Such groups now operate in more than 30 areas of the city.   $86 million in funding for the system in the 2024 fiscal year. Cities like  ,   and   have made similar investments.

In one Bronx neighborhood, the number of shooting victims fell 63 percent during a period when interrupters were active compared with rates before the program began, the study found. The results show that the approach should be adopted in “any city trying to get a handle on gun violence,” said Jeffrey Butts, who worked on the study and is the director of the college’s Research and Evaluation Center.

So when recruiters from the private Wagner mercenary group offered him freedom and a clean slate if he deployed to fight in Ukraine, Mr. Savvinov, a morgue orderly, seized the opportunity. By February, Mr. Savvinov had completed his service and was back in his native village of Kutana. That month, on Defenders of the Fatherland Day, he was staggering drunk around the snowy streets, residents said, complaining loudly that villagers showed him insufficient respect as a veteran. The next night, he   two of them, according to a law enforcement report, striking a male drinking buddy dead with a metal crowbar before killing his own estranged aunt, who lived next door, by axing her in the head, and then torching her wooden house. Russia’s practice of recruiting convicts has been the backbone of its success in Ukraine, providing an overwhelming manpower advantage in the war. But it is backfiring in tragic ways as inmates pardoned for serving in Ukraine return to Russia and commit new crimes. Overall numbers on recidivist crimes are hard to establish because the Russian government restricts the release of any public information that puts the war in a bad light. A survey of Russian court records by the independent media outlet Verstka   that at least 190 criminal cases were initiated against pardoned Wagner recruits in 2023. That included 20 cases of murder or attempted murder as well as rape, robbery and drug-related crimes, among others. Still, the Kremlin appears to be doubling down on the policy of recruiting inmates. On March 23, President Vladimir V. Putin signed a new law meant to formalize the process. Before, the criteria for pardons was opaque, and Mr. Putin pardoned convicts who had fought in Ukraine by signing decrees that were never made public. The new law established a long list of eligible crimes that were explicitly added into Russia’s criminal code, including murder, robbery and some rapes. Earning pardons is now a matter of law, not presidential decree, but convicts let out of prison to fight can get one only after their military commanders approve. Crimes not eligible include terrorism, espionage or treason, and some sex crimes involving minors, among others. “Nobody used to lock their doors in the village at night, but now they lock them with a key, even during the day,” said a resident of Kutana, a Siberian village of 1,000 people, declining in an interview to use her name out of fear that Mr. Savvinov might win another pardon if he was convicted and volunteered again to fight in Ukraine. “Normal life” was gone, she added, noting that the aunt whom he killed had once been named a “teacher of the year” and awarded a prize from the Kremlin. Similar experiences have scarred other cities and towns. In Chita, near the border with Mongolia, a Ukraine veteran was sentenced last month to 14 years in prison for   a 22-year-old prostitute to death with his bare hands. In 2020, he was sentenced to 14 years for strangling and dismembering an 18-year-old girl. In the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a former Wagner mercenary who had served 15 years on theft and fraud charges was sentenced in February to 17 years for raping two schoolgirls, aged 10 and 12. Near the southwestern city of Krasnodar last spring, a young father, Kirill Chubko, the owner of a party business, and one of his employees stopped to fix a burst tire on a darkened road one night. They encountered three highway robbers who forced them to withdraw around $2,000 from their banks before fatally stabbing them, according to a law enforcement report. The head of the gang had been sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2016 for preying on motorists but was released to serve in Ukraine. In 2017, Sergey Rudenko was sentenced to 10 years in prison for strangling his girlfriend to death with a belt. He earned his release when he signed on with Wagner to fight in Ukraine. In April 2023, in Rostov-on-Don, in southwestern Russia, Mr. Rudenko, 34, went looking for an apartment. After arguing with the real estate agent over the proposed rent, he strangled her with a cloth cord, then stabbed her in the neck, a law enforcement report said. A district court sentenced Mr. Rudenko to more than 11 years in prison. Local news reports did not name the victim, and several local residents, reached by telephone, said they knew nothing about it. The details of these crimes were drawn from numerous interviews, local investigation reports, local news articles and court records. Most relatives and friends of the murder victims spoke on the condition of anonymity, concerned that the killers might win new pardons and come after them. Those interviewed were also worried that the authorities might charge them under wartime laws against denigrating the military, which includes publicizing soldiers’ previous crimes. The Wagner group began   convicts in August 2022, with a promise of presidential pardons in exchange for signing a six-month contract. Before being disbanded last year in the wake of a failed mutiny against the Kremlin, the group said it had recruited more than 50,000 prisoners. Many of those men died, some are still fighting and an estimated 15,000 ex-convicts have returned home, according to Olga Romanova, the head of Russia Behind Bars, an NGO dealing with prisoner issues. “A great many prisoners were back on the loose, and it became a big problem,” she said. The crimes seemed to belie the official narrative that the war is being fought to make Russia safer and that veterans will constitute a new elite, she added. Crimes committed by veterans, whether from the Wagner group or otherwise, often go unreported. National media outlets have mentioned only a few sensational cases. “It is a story about invisible violence,” said Kirill Titaev, a Russian sociologist working at Yale University who specializes in criminology. “It is a big problem for the society, but one they do not recognize.” Russian commanders frequently deploy untrained convicts who join the Russian army as cannon fodder. Having survived harsh conditions in penal colonies and then a bloody war, they emerge back on the streets with zero rehabilitation. Many of them return to their communities exuding a certain swagger, experts said. They view their service as having rehabilitated them, and usually have money to burn. Their base monthly pay from Wagner of around $2,000 constituted a small fortune in much of Russia. In addition, law enforcement officers are often intimidated by the former inmates’ new status, Ms. Romanova said. Those pardoned after committing particularly shocking crimes and then serving in Ukraine include a serial killer from Sakhalin known for cannibalism; a member of a Satanist sect convicted of ritualistic slayings; and a man who killed his former girlfriend by brutally torturing her for hours. Last year, Mr. Putin played down the issue of pardoned convicts committing new crimes. “This is inevitable,” the president said. “But the negative consequences are minimal.” Although he confirmed issuing presidential pardons, the Kremlin has refused to name the recipients. Relatives of previous victims and other locals are often vocal critics of releasing criminals. In Novosibirsk, the pardoned murderer of a used-car saleswoman is now driving a taxi, despite efforts to get him dismissed. Some lawyers accuse prosecutors of slow-walking cases against veterans in hopes that the local outcry will quiet. “This is a new level of lawlessness,” said the lawyer for the widow of Mr. Chubko, who along with his employee was   by a highway gang. The lawyer’s repeated requests to prosecutors for a copy of the pardon have been denied. “They keep telling us that it is a state secret,” he said. “We are fighting the investigation more than the accused.” Mr. Chubko called his wife late on the night he was killed, telling her not to stay up, that some men he encountered on the road would help change his flat tire. The next morning, her husband, still not home, did not answer his cellphone. However, his wife reached Tatyana Mostyko, 19, who worked for her husband. Ms. Mostyko told her in a strange voice that Mr. Chubko was not available, and the wife said that she figured out later that he had already been killed. Ms. Mostyko was being driven around to various A.T.M.s and was soon murdered, according to an investigation report. The widow said attending the arraignment of the three suspects made her sick to her stomach. (The other two had petty criminal records, and there was no indication that either had served in Ukraine, according to local press reports.) “It was obvious that they had no regrets,” she said. Her husband had once remarked that recruiting soldiers from prisons was not normal, she added. “These people belong in prison,” she said. “I’m scared that they are among us. My kid and I walk in the park, and they might be walking there. It’s not like it’s written on their foreheads that they are criminals.” Oleg Matsnev  contributed reporting.  has been a Times reporter since 1995, writing about a range of topics from war to politics to the arts, both internationally and in the United States.  is a reporter and researcher, helping to cover Russian society.

Berlin Was a Beacon of Artistic Freedom. Gaza Changed Everything.,"Critic’s Notebook The home of boundary-pushing artists from around the world has been upended by debates about what can and can’t be said about Israel and the war. Supported by Reporting from Berlin When the musician Laurie Anderson was beginning her career in the early 1970s, an avant-garde artist who wanted to work at scale had to go abroad — to one place in particular. “I got my start in Germany, because of state-supported art,” recalled Anderson, who exhibited at its national museums and performed with its symphony orchestras when she was still an emerging talent. She lived for a time in West Berlin. She met Lou Reed, her future husband and a sometime Berliner himself, in Germany in 1992. Fitting, then, that she would accept a prestigious guest professorship this year at a German art school. Then, in late January, a local blogger fulminated after finding her signature among 16,000 names on a two-year-old open letter that denounced “apartheid” in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The university then called, seeking explanations. Rather than distill her thoughts about “this unbelievably tragic war” into the kind of public statement they seemed to want, she withdrew. “It did teach me that I didn’t really want to have that kind of sponsorship,” she concluded. “If I’d known they were going to ask things like that, I never would have accepted that job in the first place.” She’s far from the only artist who finds herself unsure of her welcome here these days. The arts scene in Germany — and especially Berlin — has been turned upside down by Hamas’s attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, and the siege and bombardment of Gaza. Prizes have been rescinded. Conferences called off. Plays taken off the boards. Government cultural officials have suggested tying funding to what artists and institutions say about the conflict, and media — both traditional and social — bubble with public denunciations of this writer, that artist, this D.J., that dancer. The disinvitations have brought counter-boycotts. And a climate of fear and recrimination has put Berlin’s status as an international cultural capital in greater hazard than at any time since 1989. Berlin had once been the artistic beacon of all Europe, but what’s happening here today is a very German story. The country’s responsibility for the Holocaust still defines a cultural sector whose institutions are committed to a national process of reckoning and atonement. That culture of remembrance also undergirds Germany’s staunch support for Israel, and the strict limits it places on criticisms of its ally. (Only recently has the rising toll in Gaza prompted some German leaders to  ) So while artists around the world — from   to   — have been vocal about the war, in Germany such statements can have a major cost: canceled performances, lost funding, and accusations of antisemitism in a society where no charge is more serious. “Berlin was broke, but a community was there,” said the electroclash star Peaches, who has lived here since 2000, when we met up for breakfast in Prenzlauer Berg. I asked her what’s changed lately, and she noted how risk-taking institutions were already running scared amid threats to funding. “What was going on here was openness to all these intersections. And since the last few months, there’s been a lot of that taken away.” That sense of new limitations, new controls, new anxieties, is already exacting a price on culture in a city that had made a welcome of artists into its post-Wall calling card. This angst makes it harder for us to work internationally, attract the best talent on the highest level and bring diverse audiences together,” said Klaus Biesenbach, the director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, who previously led museums in New York and Los Angeles. “If the artists leave, one of the last real bonuses that Berlin has would be gone.” The cancellations, postponements and uproars have hit every cultural sector, with anger and accusations coming from as high as the chancellery. The Berlin International Film Festival saw withdrawals and protests this year — and after its closing ceremony, at which several laureates called for a cease-fire in Gaza, federal and state officials issued threats to withhold future support. D.J.s have been dropped from lineups at Berghain and other clubs, sometimes after posting anti-Israeli statements, but often for much milder support for Palestinian lives. The Maxim Gorki Theater, one of the city’s most acclaimed playhouses, canceled a prizewinning play about Israelis and Palestinians in Berlin — leading several intellectuals and artists to cancel appearances there in turn. In the galleries of the KW Institute for Contemporary Art, a hub for the city’s art scene, recently shipped sculptures are sitting in unpacked crates. Their creators now refuse to exhibit in Germany to protest what they describe as restrictions of speech supporting Palestinians. Some cultural leaders are raising alarms. In January, the Berlin state government proposed a new funding clause that would require grantees to sign a document opposing “any form of antisemitism” — and used a definition that listed certain criticisms of Israeli policy as antisemitic. Artists protested, and the proposal was withdrawn, but the outgoing director of the Goethe-Institut, which promotes German language and literature abroad,   that “longstanding partners in the international cultural world are losing confidence in the liberalism of German democracy.” For many artists, especially foreigners who settled in Berlin as a place of freedom and cultural abundance, the very survival of the city as an artistic capital is in doubt, or perhaps already gone. “Berlin, in my view, is not a place where artists can create freely,” said Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and dissident, who keeps a studio in Berlin but no longer lives here. “Whenever I hear about German government officials imposing restrictions on artists’ freedom of speech, or expression, it fills me with despair.” It’s of course not just in the capital. The Frankfurt Book Fair   for Adania Shibli, an acclaimed Palestinian writer and Berlin resident. The city of Bremen reneged on its own prize ceremony for the Jewish writer Masha Gessen over an   of Nazi-occupied cities. The Berlin-based artists Jumana Manna, who is Palestinian, and Candice Breitz, who is Jewish, both had exhibitions at regional museums canceled on the grounds of (as usual) controversial social media posts. Even Greta Thunberg, the climate Cassandra, has been   after wearing a kaffiyeh and calling for a cease-fire at a recent protest. But it is Berlin that stands to lose the most from all these disinvitations and denunciations, and from the larger malaise in German democracy from which they spring. The success of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, and the broader advance of the populist right in Europe, have shaken postwar and post-Wall norms of historical responsibility. The arrival of a million refugees from Syria and elsewhere in 2015 continues to shape ongoing debates about who is a German.  , triggered by restrictions on government debt, spell trouble for a capital that still has three major opera houses. All this while indisputably antisemitic rhetoric, and even violence, have been rising in Germany. In October, masked assailants chucked Molotov cocktails at a synagogue (they missed; no one was hurt). Anti-Jewish slurs and stars of David were painted on government buildings and residences. When pro-Palestinian activists came to the Hamburger Bahnhof, one of Berlin’s leading institutions for contemporary art, and shouted down the director of one of the country’s Jewish museums with slogans such as “Zionism is a crime,” they affirmed the belief of many here that anti-Israeli rhetoric is just a step away from antisemitism. Against that backdrop, some Jewish Berliners see criticism of Israel as much more than a foreign policy dispute. “I’m an aggressive Zionist for only one reason: because I want to survive,” Maxim Biller, the author of the novel “Mama Odessa” and one of the country’s leading columnists, told me over coffee. “And I can be a German writer with a Jewish project here only because there is a state of Israel.” Naturally there is a German compound noun for that interdependence, endlessly slung around and debated in the last few months. The word is  , or “reason of state”: a national interest that is not just nonnegotiable but existential, defining the state as such. Angela Merkel, the former chancellor, described Israel’s security as Germany’s  in a historic address to the Knesset in 2008. Her successor, Olaf Scholz, has repeatedly invoked  in his defenses of Israeli policy since Oct. 7. “  means: The existence of Israel is a condition of possibility for the existence of Germany,” explained Johannes von Moltke, a professor of German cultural history at the University of Michigan, who’s currently in Berlin. “Because if there is no Israel, then Germany’s guilt is all-consuming again. And you can’t countenance that possibility.” In other words, the cultural crackup of the last few months only   to be part of an international conflict. It is, in fact, resolutely German. What is really being fought over here is a hazy, transcendent national concept that, since Oct. 7, has overtaken more firmly constitutional principles of free expression and free association. The tensions have been building since at least 2019, when the federal Parliament adopted a resolution  , and urging local governments and “public stakeholders” not to fund organizations or individuals that support it. That makes a big difference here, since so many artists, writers and musicians receive generous government aid. The resolution, though nonbinding, led some cultural institutions to rescind invitations to critics of Israeli policy, and many more to take a hesitant approach. “People in cultural institutions are risk-averse,” said Tobias Haberkorn, who edits the  , a new literary publication. “So if they have to decide, ‘Am I going to invite this or that artist with a Middle Eastern background, or not?’ I can very well see them not inviting them. Just to avoid the potential hassle.” Since Oct. 7, accusations of antisemitism have flown much more broadly. Some are merited. Many others are dubious. Quite a number of those accused of antisemitism have been Jewish, such as Gessen. “There are many Jewish perspectives, and that is not being honored here in a country where the history cannot be excused,” said Peaches, who is also Jewish. “For any progressive Jewish person who is thinking about what is going on, and understanding the history of what is going on, to be called antisemitic — by   — is ridiculous. Never did I think in 2024 that I would be thinking about that.” Yet it’s worth pointing out how few of these accusations revolve around cultural production. It is rare for Berlin’s theaters or festivals to cancel someone for what they   sing or paint or film. What gets you now are statements, posts, likes, signatures: the imperatives of social media, which are swallowing culture wholesale. Once debates like this would have played out in Germany’s elite press, where intellectuals clashed over the country’s moral responsibility to the past. Today the national papers, and the institutions too, are playing catch-up to   from the provincial city of Bochum that took down Anderson and many others. Perhaps the lowest point yet came at the end of this year’s film festival, when numerous prizewinners called for a cease-fire in Gaza; two went further, using the words “genocide” and “apartheid” to describe Israel’s actions. That prompted Germany’s culture minister, Claudia Roth, to announce an inquiry into the film festival’s governance. In  , Roth said that “the freedom of the arts includes curatorial responsibility,” and suggested that the festival’s organizers had to ask themselves: “Which films are being selected? How are the juries appointed?” The festival’s outgoing artistic director, Carlo Chatrian, hit back at that government interference  , accusing German officials and news organizations of rhetoric that “weaponizes and instrumentalizes antisemitism for political means.” Surely this city ought to have learned by now that directing culture toward political ends rarely ends well. Those who have forgotten might take a walk over to the Gendarmenmarkt, a grand central square now gashed by construction barriers, and its monumental statue of a German playwright and philosopher with a rather subtler understanding of how culture and government inform each other. His name was Friedrich Schiller, and what he saw was that the arts were not aristocratic luxuries, not decorations; they were the very motor of human freedom. The arts, Schiller  , “enjoy an absolute immunity from human capriciousness. The political legislator can bar the way to its domain, but he cannot rule within it.” This freedom of the arts still defines Berlin, which knows better than most cities what dangers lurk when they are overregulated. It defined the Weimar period, when Otto Dix caricatured the powerful and August Sander photographed society without embellishment. And the postwar era, when novelists forged a new German literature in a register that definitively broke from the Nazi past. And also the Cold War, when punk bands on either side of the Wall made music in defiance of national aims. And especially the heady years after reunification, when a global generation of designers and D.J.s reestablished the unlovely city as Europe’s beating heart. Lose that cultural freedom and you lose much more than a “scene.” You lose the very ground — the ground of sympathetic imagination — upon which you combat antisemitism and all other forms of bigotry. “The opportunity to experiment for creatives and artists from all over the world is one of the most important things Berlin still has going for it.” said Biesenbach. “We need to protect it.” , a critic at large for The Times, writes about art and culture in the U.S. and abroad.

Gaza War Turns Spotlight on Long Pipeline of U.S. Weapons to Israel,"Advertisement Supported by President Biden sends arms to Israel under an Obama-era $38 billion aid agreement that runs until 2026. Israel’s purchases include the types of bombs dropped in Gaza.  and  Michael Crowley and Edward Wong, diplomatic correspondents in Washington, have traveled regularly to the Middle East with the U.S. secretary of state since the Israel-Gaza war began. In the fall of 2016, the Obama administration sealed a major military agreement with Israel that committed the United States to giving the country $38 billion in arms over 10 years. “The continued supply of the world’s most advanced weapons technology will ensure that Israel has the ability to defend itself from all manner of threats,” President Barack Obama said. At the time,   was uncontroversial. It was a period of relative calm for Israel, and few officials in Washington expressed concern about how the American arms might one day be used. Now that military aid package, which guarantees Israel $3.3 billion per year to buy weapons, along with another $500 million annually for missile defense, has become a flashpoint for the Biden administration. A vocal minority of lawmakers in Congress backed by liberal activists are demanding that President Biden restrict or even halt arms shipments to Israel because of its military campaign in Gaza. Mr. Biden has been sharply critical of what he on one occasion called “indiscriminate bombing” in Israel’s war campaign, but he has  .

Legislation mandates that the U.S. government help Israel maintain force superiority — or its “ ” — over other Middle Eastern nations.

The United States has sent   to the country since the Oct. 7 killings by Hamas attackers, but many were   and the State Department long ago and funded with money mandated by the Obama-era agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding. “At any given time, delivery on these sales is constantly taking place,” said Dana Stroul, who recently departed as the Pentagon’s top official for Middle East affairs. Mr. Biden has the power to limit any foreign arms deliveries, even ones previously approved by Congress. Far from cutting off Israel, however, he is pushing a request he made shortly after the Oct. 7 attacks for $14 billion in additional arms aid to the country and U.S. military operations in the Middle East. The money has been stalled in Congress amid disputes over Ukraine aid and U.S. border security and  . Because of a  , the State Department does not have to tell Congress and the public about some new arms orders placed by Israel since Oct. 7 since they  . Congressional officials have criticized the secrecy, which stands in contrast to the Biden administration’s public fanfare around arms deliveries to Ukraine. Since the Hamas attacks, State Department officials have continued to authorize arms shipments to Israel that are tranches of orders, or what officials call “cases,” approved earlier by the department and by Congress — often years ago, and often for delivery in batches over a long period. Officials describe this step as pro forma. The authorizations have occurred almost daily in recent weeks, and are in line with Mr. Biden’s policy of giving full support to Israel.   But Mr. Biden  . In a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Biden warned that U.S. policy could change if Israel did not take more action to protect civilians and aid workers in Gaza, according to a White House summary of the conversation. Israel regularly receives arms from the U.S. Defense Department, as well as directly from American weapons makers. The largest arms orders are often filled over years in smaller groups of specific items. For such cases, arms buyers like Israel come to the U.S. government saying they are ready to pay for part of an order. When the Defense Department is supplying the arms — which includes the most expensive weapons systems — the State Department then tells the Pentagon to issue a letter of acceptance to the buyer. That authorization is often a pro forma step, and a buyer signing it means there is now a legal contract to fill that part of the larger order. The State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which manages foreign defense relationships and arms transfers, typically acts within two days of hearing about a buyer’s fulfillment request to tell the Defense Department to issue the letter. If defense officials decide to fill the case by placing an order with a U.S. weapons maker, the assembly and shipment would normally take years. For Israel’s immediate needs since Oct. 7, defense officials have drawn from U.S. military stockpiles, including  . Israel and other nations also sign contracts directly with American weapons makers. These orders go through a State Department review (and occasionally congressional review, depending on the price tag). The State Department regularly issues four-year export licenses to the companies, and   on commercial orders. Israel is awaiting State Department approval for   it requested before Oct. 7 — a direct commercial order that has drawn scrutiny from some officials in the department and lawmakers because of   against Palestinians in the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, Israel has asked the United States to expedite filling cases from long-existing orders, U.S. officials said. State and Pentagon officials have complied. Given the politics around Israel, any change would have to come from Mr. Biden. Israel’s recent requested fulfillments — and the resulting drawdowns from U.S. stockpiles — have included munitions ranging from 250- to 2,000-pound bombs. Many cases have been for 500-pound bombs, said a U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivities and opacity around arms sales. Some of what Israel has requested since Oct. 7 is meant to enhance its defenses against actors besides Hamas, including Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias in the region, as well as Iran itself. U.S. officials say one reason for their reluctance to limit arms sales to Israel is the risk of weakening its deterrence against those foes. Shortly before seven aid workers for World Food Kitchen   on Monday, State Department officials told the Pentagon to issue a letter of acceptance to Israel for a case of munitions, U.S. officials said. That batch follows other shipments sent to Israel over the years to fulfill large munitions orders approved by Congress and the State Department in both 2012 and 2015, U.S. officials said. In rare instances, an assistant secretary of state has asked department officials to refrain from telling Pentagon counterparts to issue a letter of acceptance because of concerns about the customer country, said Josh Paul, who   in October to protest Mr. Biden’s war policy. “They can say, ‘You know what, we changed our minds,’” Mr. Paul said, stressing that top U.S. officials can intervene at any point before the customer receives a title of ownership. Since Oct. 7, Israel has placed new orders. The State Department only needs to notify Congress when a price tag is above a certain threshold. That amount varies by country and the type of military aid. If Israel orders a major weapons system, the department only tells Congress if the tranche is valued at more than $25 million. Congressional officials are pushing the State Department to give them more information on  . At least three of the new Israeli orders have crossed the threshold required for congressional review, however — and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken bypassed that twice. Last December, Mr. Blinken invoked a rare emergency authority to avoid legislative review and push through two of those orders worth $253 million in total, for   and for  . The Pentagon then drew from U.S. stockpiles to send those quickly to Israel. The State Department told Congress in January about a third one —   that Israel placed after Oct. 7. The department is seeking approval from four lawmakers on two congressional committees with oversight of arms transfers. Two Republicans approved the order in January, a U.S. official said, and   so far. The Biden administration is pressuring the Democratic lawmakers to approve the order, after which the State Department would officially notify it. The order is one of the biggest from Israel in years. The first jets would not be delivered until 2029 at the earliest, one official said. And Israeli officials are expected to place an order for F-35 jets soon, U.S. officials said. Martin Indyk, a special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the Obama administration, said “the problem with this American largess is that it has bred a sense of entitlement among Israelis over the years.” Israel’s dependence on the United States has grown “exponentially because its deterrent capability collapsed on Oct. 7,” he said, noting that Israel would need the U.S. military to help ward off major assaults by Hezbollah or Iran. The Biden administration needs to use that leverage to shape the Israeli government’s behavior, he added. Within the State Department, there has been some dissent about the arms transfers, reflected in   last fall and in an internal exchange after a recent White House move. Mr. Biden   requiring all recipients of U.S. military aid to provide written promises that their forces abide by international law. The move was intended to defuse growing pressure in Congress. Critics say the exercise adds little to existing U.S. requirements that military aid recipients observe international and humanitarian law. After Israel  , officials in the two State Department bureaus that focus on human rights and on refugees raised concerns with Mr. Blinken about Israel’s commitment, a U.S. official said. But Mr. Blinken accepted Israel’s assurances.

Israel’s purchases include the types of bombs dropped in Gaza.  and  Michael Crowley and Edward Wong, diplomatic correspondents in Washington, have traveled regularly to the Middle East with the U.S. secretary of state since the Israel-Gaza war began. In the fall of 2016, the Obama administration sealed a major military agreement with Israel that committed the United States to giving the country $38 billion in arms over 10 years. “The continued supply of the world’s most advanced weapons technology will ensure that Israel has the ability to defend itself from all manner of threats,” President Barack Obama said. At the time,   was uncontroversial. It was a period of relative calm for Israel, and few officials in Washington expressed concern about how the American arms might one day be used. Now that military aid package, which guarantees Israel $3.3 billion per year to buy weapons, along with another $500 million annually for missile defense, has become a flashpoint for the Biden administration. A vocal minority of lawmakers in Congress backed by liberal activists are demanding that President Biden restrict or even halt arms shipments to Israel because of its military campaign in Gaza. Mr. Biden has been sharply critical of what he on one occasion called “indiscriminate bombing” in Israel’s war campaign, but he has  .

Mr. Biden has the power to limit any foreign arms deliveries, even ones previously approved by Congress. Far from cutting off Israel, however, he is pushing a request he made shortly after the Oct. 7 attacks for $14 billion in additional arms aid to the country and U.S. military operations in the Middle East.

How ‘All in the Family’ Explains Biden’s Strength Among Seniors,"Advertisement Yesterday’s hippies have become today’s seniors — and they’re still voting Democratic.     Nate Cohn is The Times’s chief political analyst. It’s usually a given that Republicans will win voters 65 and over, but that’s not the case in this election. Instead, polls show President Biden close or even ahead among seniors, continuing a steady — and overlooked — trend of Democratic gains among older voters. Mr. Biden’s strength among seniors might be surprising, but the likeliest explanation is deceptively simple: At every stage earlier in their lives, many of today’s seniors voted Democratic. They just got older. To understand why, consider Archie Bunker, the working-class “ ” from the 1970s hit sitcom “All in the Family,” and his TV family. Archie arguing with his son-in-law, Michael, whom he called “meathead.” He may be saying something we can’t print. CBS, via Getty Images The show revolved around Archie’s feuds with his 20-something feminist daughter, Gloria, and his liberal son-in-law, Michael, over race, gender and politics. (The existence of a 30-minute-long   called “Racist Archie Bunker Compilation” — which has nearly two million views — tells you most of what you need to know about the show and his character.) It’s not unreasonable if Archie is your image of an older voter. As recently as 15 years ago, every single voter over age 65 was born before the end of World War II and came of age before the cultural revolution of the 1960s that shaped the views of many baby boomers voters  . Archie’s generation was the only one that reacted to the 2008 nomination of Barack Obama by shifting  : A higher share of them voted for John McCain in 2008 than for George W. Bush in 2004. But in 2024, Archie shouldn’t be your image of a senior. Archie would be 100 years old today; his generation, called the Greatest Generation, has almost entirely died. The generation that came after Archie’s — the conservative Silent Generation, who grew up during the popular Eisenhower presidency in the “Leave It to Beaver” 1950s — has mostly died, too. Just 20 percent of the Silent Generation is alive today. Instead, you may be better off thinking of Michael and Gloria. They are boomers, and they would be in their 70s today. Archie and Edith’s chairs are empty. Michael (Rob Reiner) and Gloria (Sally Struthers) grew up. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters As a result, today’s seniors bear little resemblance to those from 10 or 15 years ago. Today, Madonna is a senior. So are Ellen DeGeneres and Katie Couric. By Election Day, Magic Johnson will be 65.  ​Even though they may not feel like older voters to you, these boomers are the new seniors. Some seniors of the 2024 election Mark Cuban, 65 Denis Leary, 66 Katie Couric, 67 Magic Johnson, 64* Weird Al Yankovic, 64* Caitlyn Jenner, 74 Madonna, 65 Flavor Flav, 65 Tim Allen, 70 Spike Lee, 67 Geena Davis, 68 *Will turn 65 before Election Day Some seniors of the 2024 election Mark Cuban, 65 Denis Leary, 66 Katie Couric, 67 Magic Johnson, 64* Madonna, 65 Weird Al Yankovic, 64* Caitlyn Jenner, 74 Flavor Flav, 65 Tim Allen, 70 Spike Lee, 67 Geena Davis, 68 *Will turn 65 before Election Day All together, boomers will make up more than 70 percent of seniors in 2024, up from zero percent when Mr. Obama — himself a baby boomer — won the presidency in 2008. Boomers have a reputation for being conservative, but they’re more liberal than the voters older than them. The aging of the boomers, along with the dwindling ranks of those even older than the boomers, helps explain the steady Democratic gains among seniors over the last decade. The “Age 65+” Vote by Generation,  12 Years Ago and Today Simply by getting older, boomers have made seniors a more liberal voting group.

But in all likelihood, Mr. Obama won the voters who are seniors today. Voters aged 53 to 64 in 2012 — those 65 to 76 today — backed Mr. Obama by three points, based on a large compilation of survey data. As a group, they would have canceled much of Mr. Romney’s lead among those 65 and over. At the same time, millions more conservative voters from older generations have died. Those who remain are disproportionately women and college graduates, and may be somewhat less Republican. Consider the character Mary Richards, from “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” She made it, after all. She had spunk. Bettmann/Getty Images The fictional Mary was born in 1940 and represented the new possibilities for women at work and in society. Mary, who went on to get a master’s degree, would be 84 today and might be expected to be a Democratic voter. Many men of her generation, especially those without college degrees, didn’t make it to that age: Just 21 percent of 84-year-olds in 2022 were white men without degrees, according to census data. American women  than men on average, and college graduates live about   than those without a degree. Of course, just because Mr. Obama most likely won today’s seniors doesn’t mean President Biden will do so. But in the last presidential election, Mr. Biden won 48 percent of seniors, a tally almost identical to our estimate of how Mr. Obama probably fared among the same voters. The simplest explanation is that compositional change, rather than a change in attitudes, has been driving Democratic gains. Over the last four years, the last cohort of relatively Democratic boomers became seniors (the youngest boomers are politically more like Gen X and haven’t hit 65 yet). It’s entirely possible that Mr. Biden won today’s seniors in 2020. If so, Mr. Biden may not need to flip a single voter to turn seniors from red to blue in 2024. The aging of the boomers into the 65-and-older category has had the effect of making the 45-to-64 group more conservative. That’s because the relatively conservative Gen X now makes up the preponderance of those 45 to 64. Much as the boomers have long been more liberal than the Silent Generation, Gen X has long been more conservative than the boomers. Gen X-ers came up in the midst of the Reagan revolution and were reflected in the hit show “Family Ties.” Reading the president’s lips. NBC, via Getty Images Alex P. Keaton, a Reagan-loving teenager with his mind set on great wealth, clashed with his boomer parents, former hippies who had protested the Vietnam War and joined the Peace Corps. Mr. Romney won voters who were ages 41 to 52 back in 2012, and who now make up many of the 45-to-64 group today (Alex Keaton would be 59 today). For good measure, polls suggest they have shifted to the right over the last decade. In fact, the polls suggest almost every age group under age 50 has   since 2012 (although they still lean left overall).  Donald J. Trump, for instance, undoubtedly did much better in 2020 among the voters who were 18 to 29 in 2012 than Mr. Romney did among the same cohort. Voter registration data shows the same pattern. Perhaps surprisingly, Democratic losses among younger voters over the last decade have canceled out the departure of the Archie Bunkers from the electorate, which is one reason the coming presidential election appears to be so close this year.

What to Know About Tech Companies Using A.I. to Teach Their Own A.I.,"Advertisement Supported by As artificial intelligence developers run out of data to train their models, they are turning to “synthetic data” — data made by the A.I. itself.  and  Cade Metz reports on artificial intelligence.

How Tech Giants Cut Corners to Harvest Data for A.I.,"OpenAI, Google and Meta ignored corporate policies, altered their own rules and discussed skirting copyright law as they sought online information to train their newest artificial intelligence systems. Supported by  and  Reporting from San Francisco, Washington and New York In late 2021,   faced a supply problem. The artificial intelligence lab had exhausted every reservoir of reputable English-language text on the internet as it developed its latest A.I. system. It needed more data to train the next version of its technology — lots more. So OpenAI researchers created a speech recognition tool called Whisper. It could transcribe the audio from YouTube videos, yielding new conversational text that would make an A.I. system smarter. Some OpenAI employees discussed how such a move might go against YouTube’s rules, three people with knowledge of the conversations said. YouTube, which is owned by Google, prohibits use of its videos for applications that are “independent” of the video platform. Ultimately, an OpenAI team transcribed more than one million hours of YouTube videos, the people said. The team included Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president, who personally helped collect the videos, two of the people said. The texts were then fed into a system called  , which was widely considered one of the world’s most powerful A.I. models and was the basis of the latest version of the ChatGPT chatbot. The race to lead A.I. has become a desperate hunt for the digital data needed to advance the technology. To obtain that data, tech companies including OpenAI, Google and Meta have cut corners, ignored corporate policies and debated bending the law, according to an examination by The New York Times. At Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, managers, lawyers and engineers last year discussed buying the publishing house Simon & Schuster to procure long works, according to recordings of internal meetings obtained by The Times. They also conferred on gathering copyrighted data from across the internet, even if that meant facing lawsuits. Negotiating licenses with publishers, artists, musicians and the news industry would take too long, they said. Like OpenAI, Google transcribed YouTube videos to harvest text for its A.I. models, five people with knowledge of the company’s practices said. That potentially violated the copyrights to the videos, which belong to their creators. Last year, Google also broadened its terms of service. One motivation for the change, according to members of the company’s privacy team and an internal message viewed by The Times, was to allow Google to be able to tap publicly available Google Docs, restaurant reviews on Google Maps and other online material for more of its A.I. products. The companies’ actions illustrate how online information — news stories, fictional works, message board posts, Wikipedia articles, computer programs, photos, podcasts and movie clips — has increasingly become the lifeblood of the booming A.I. industry. Creating innovative systems depends on having enough data to teach the technologies to instantly produce text, images, sounds and videos that resemble what a human creates. The volume of data is crucial. Leading chatbot systems have   spanning as many as three trillion words, or roughly twice the number of words stored in Oxford University’s Bodleian Library, which has collected manuscripts since 1602. The most prized data, A.I. researchers said, is high-quality information, such as published books and articles, which have been carefully written and edited by professionals. For years, the internet — with sites like Wikipedia and   — was a seemingly endless source of data. But as A.I. advanced, tech companies sought more repositories. Google and Meta, which have billions of users who produce search queries and social media posts every day, were largely limited by privacy laws and their own policies from drawing on much of that content for A.I. Their situation is urgent. Tech companies could run through the high-quality data on the internet as soon as 2026, according to Epoch, a research institute. The companies are using the data faster than it is being produced. “The only practical way for these tools to exist is if they can be trained on massive amounts of data without having to license that data,” Sy Damle, a lawyer who represents Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm,   last year in a public discussion about copyright law. “The data needed is so massive that even collective licensing really can’t work.” Tech companies are so hungry for new data that some are developing “synthetic” information. This is not organic data created by humans, but text, images and code that A.I. models produce — in other words, the systems learn from what they themselves generate. OpenAI said each of its A.I. models “has a unique data set that we curate to help their understanding of the world and remain globally competitive in research.” Google said that its A.I. models “are trained on some YouTube content,” which was allowed under agreements with YouTube creators, and that the company did not use data from office apps outside of an experimental program. Meta said it had “made aggressive investments” to integrate A.I. into its services and had billions of publicly shared images and videos from Instagram and Facebook for training its models. For creators, the growing use of their works by A.I. companies has prompted   over copyright and licensing. The Times   last year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train A.I. chatbots. OpenAI and Microsoft have said using the articles was “fair use,” or allowed under copyright law, because they transformed the works for a different purpose. More than 10,000 trade groups, authors, companies and others submitted comments last year about the use of creative works by A.I. models to the  , a federal agency that is preparing guidance on how copyright law applies in the A.I. era. Justine Bateman, a filmmaker, former actress and author of two books, told the Copyright Office that A.I. models were taking content — including her writing and films — without permission or payment. “This is the largest theft in the United States, period,” she said in an interview. In January 2020, Jared Kaplan, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, published a   on A.I. that stoked the appetite for online data. His conclusion was unequivocal: The more data there was to train a   — the technology that drives online chatbots — the better it would perform. Just as a student learns more by reading more books, large language models can better pinpoint patterns in text and be more accurate with more information. “Everyone was very surprised that these trends — these scaling laws as we call them — were basically as precise as what you see in astronomy or physics,” said Dr. Kaplan, who published the paper with nine OpenAI researchers. (He now works at the A.I. start-up Anthropic.) “Scale is all you need” soon became a rallying cry for A.I. Researchers have long used large public databases of digital information to develop A.I., including Wikipedia and Common Crawl, a database of more than 250 billion web pages collected since 2007. Researchers often “cleaned” the data by removing hate speech and other unwanted text before using it to train A.I. models. In 2020, data sets were tiny by today’s standards. One database containing 30,000 photographs from the photo website Flickr was considered a vital resource at the time. After Dr. Kaplan’s paper, that amount of data was no longer enough. It became all about “just making things really big,” said Brandon Duderstadt, the chief executive of Nomic, an A.I. company in New York. Before 2020, most   used relatively little training data. Mr. Kaplan’s paper, released in 2020, led to a   defined by GPT-3, a large language model, where researchers began including more data in their models … … much, much more data. Note: Includes estimates. Source:  . When OpenAI unveiled   in November 2020, it was trained on the largest amount of data to date — about 300 billion “tokens,” which are essentially words or pieces of words. After learning from that data, the system generated text with astounding accuracy, writing blog posts, poetry and its own computer programs. In 2022, DeepMind, an A.I. lab owned by Google, went further. It tested 400 A.I. models and varied the amount of training data and other factors. The top-performing models used even more data than Dr. Kaplan had predicted in his paper. One model, Chinchilla, was trained on 1.4 trillion tokens. It was soon overtaken. Last year, researchers from China released an A.I. model,  , which was trained on 3.2 trillion tokens from English and Chinese texts. Google also unveiled an A.I. system,  , which  . In May,  , the chief executive of OpenAI, acknowledged that A.I. companies would use up all viable data on the internet. “That will run out,” he   in a speech at a tech conference. Mr. Altman had seen the phenomenon up close. At OpenAI, researchers had gathered data for years, cleaned it and fed it into a vast pool of text to train the company’s language models. They had mined the computer code repository GitHub, vacuumed up databases of chess moves and drawn on data describing high school tests and homework assignments from the website Quizlet. By late 2021, those supplies were depleted, said eight people with knowledge of the company, who were not authorized to speak publicly. OpenAI was desperate for more data to develop its next-generation A.I. model, GPT-4. So employees discussed transcribing podcasts, audiobooks and YouTube videos, the people said. They talked about creating data from scratch with A.I. systems. They also considered buying start-ups that had collected large amounts of digital data. OpenAI eventually made Whisper, the speech recognition tool, to transcribe YouTube videos and podcasts, six people said. But YouTube prohibits people from not only using its videos for “independent” applications, but also accessing its videos by “any automated means (such as robots, botnets or scrapers).” OpenAI employees knew they were wading into a legal gray area, the people said, but believed that training A.I. with the videos was fair use. Mr. Brockman, OpenAI’s president, was listed in   as a creator of Whisper. He personally helped gather YouTube videos and fed them into the technology, two people said. Mr. Brockman referred requests for comment to OpenAI, which said it uses “numerous sources” of data. Last year, OpenAI released GPT-4, which drew on the more than one million hours of YouTube videos that Whisper had transcribed. Mr. Brockman led the team that developed GPT-4. Some Google employees were aware that OpenAI had harvested YouTube videos for data, two people with knowledge of the companies said. But they didn’t stop OpenAI because Google had also used transcripts of YouTube videos to train its A.I. models, the people said. That practice may have violated the copyrights of YouTube creators. So if Google made a fuss about OpenAI, there might be a public outcry against its own methods, the people said. Matt Bryant, a Google spokesman, said the company had no knowledge of OpenAI’s practices and prohibited “unauthorized scraping or downloading of YouTube content.” Google takes action when it has a clear legal or technical basis to do so, he said. Google’s rules allowed it to tap YouTube user data to develop new features for the video platform. But it was unclear whether Google could use YouTube data to build a commercial service beyond the video platform, such as a chatbot. Geoffrey Lottenberg, an intellectual property lawyer with the law firm Berger Singerman, said Google’s language about what it could and could not do with YouTube video transcripts was vague. “Whether the data could be used for a new commercial service is open to interpretation and could be litigated,” he said. In late 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and set off  , Google researchers and engineers discussed tapping other user data. Billions of words sat in people’s Google Docs and other free Google apps. But the company’s privacy restrictions limited how they could use the data, three people with knowledge of Google’s practices said. In June, Google’s legal department asked the privacy team to draft language to broaden what the company could use consumer data for, according to two members of the privacy team and an internal message viewed by The Times. The employees were told Google wanted to use people’s publicly available content in Google Docs, Google Sheets and related apps for an array of A.I. products. The employees said they didn’t know if the company had previously trained A.I. on such data. At the time, Google’s privacy policy said the company could use publicly available information only to “help train Google’s language models and build features like Google Translate.” The privacy team wrote new terms so Google could tap the data for its “A.I. models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard and Cloud AI capabilities,” which was a wider collection of A.I. technologies. “What is the end goal here?” one member of the privacy team asked in an internal message. “How broad are we going?” The team was told specifically to release the new terms on the Fourth of July weekend, when people were typically focused on the holiday, the employees said. The revised policy debuted on July 1, at the start of the long weekend. Here are the changes Google made to its privacy policy last year for its free consumer apps. Google uses information to improve our services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, we use publicly available information to help train Google’s  models and build  features like Google Translate .

Source: Google By The New York Times In August, two privacy team members said, they pressed managers on whether Google could start using data from free consumer versions of Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides. They were not given clear answers, they said. Mr. Bryant said that the privacy policy changes had been made for clarity and that Google did not use information from Google Docs or related apps to train language models “without explicit permission” from users, referring to a voluntary program that allows users to test experimental features. “We did not start training on additional types of data based on this language change,” he said. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, had invested in A.I. for years — but suddenly found himself behind when OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022. He immediately pushed to  , calling executives and engineers at all hours of the night to push them to develop a rival chatbot, said three current and former employees, who were not authorized to discuss confidential conversations. But by early last year, Meta had hit the same hurdle as its rivals: not enough data. Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s vice president of generative A.I., told executives that his team had used almost every available English-language book, essay, poem and news article on the internet to develop a model, according to recordings of internal meetings, which were shared by an employee.  Meta could not match ChatGPT unless it got more data, Mr. Al-Dahle told colleagues. In March and April 2023, some of the company’s business development leaders, engineers and lawyers met nearly daily to tackle the problem. Some debated paying $10 a book for the full licensing rights to new titles. They discussed buying Simon & Schuster, which publishes authors such as J.K. Rowling and Stephen King, according to the recordings. They also talked about how they had summarized books, essays and other works from the internet without permission and discussed sucking up more, even if that meant facing lawsuits. One lawyer warned of “ethical” concerns around taking intellectual property from artists but was met with silence, according to the recordings. Mr. Zuckerberg demanded a solution, employees said. “The capability that Mark is looking for in the product is just something that we currently aren’t able to deliver,” one engineer said. While Meta operates giant social networks, it didn’t have troves of user posts at its disposal, two employees said. Many Facebook users had deleted their earlier posts, and the platform wasn’t where people wrote essay-type content, they said. Meta was also limited by privacy changes it introduced after   over sharing its users’ data with Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company. Mr. Zuckerberg said in   that the billions of publicly shared videos and photos on Facebook and Instagram are “greater than the Common Crawl data set.” During their recorded discussions, Meta executives talked about how they had hired contractors in Africa to aggregate summaries of fiction and nonfiction. The summaries included copyrighted content “because we have no way of not collecting that,” a manager said in one meeting. Meta’s executives said OpenAI seemed to have used copyrighted material without permission. It would take Meta too long to negotiate licenses with publishers, artists, musicians and the news industry, they said, according to the recordings. “The only thing that’s holding us back from being as good as ChatGPT is literally just data volume,” Nick Grudin, a vice president of global partnership and content, said in one meeting. OpenAI appeared to be taking copyrighted material and Meta could follow this “market precedent,” he added. Meta’s executives agreed to lean on a 2015 court decision involving the  , according to the recordings. In that case, Google was permitted to scan, digitize and catalog books in an online database after arguing that it had reproduced only snippets of the works online and had transformed the originals, which made it fair use. Using data to train A.I. systems, Meta’s lawyers said in their meetings, should similarly be fair use. At least two employees raised concerns about using intellectual property and not paying authors and other artists fairly or at all, according to the recordings. One employee recounted a separate discussion about copyrighted data with senior executives including Chris Cox, Meta’s chief product officer, and said no one in that meeting considered the ethics of using people’s creative works. OpenAI’s Mr. Altman had a plan to deal with the looming data shortage. Companies like his, he said at the May conference, would eventually train their A.I. on text generated by A.I. — otherwise known as synthetic data. Since an A.I. model can produce humanlike text, Mr. Altman and others have argued, the systems can create additional data to develop better versions of themselves. This would help developers build increasingly powerful technology and reduce their dependence on copyrighted data. “As long as you can get over the synthetic data event horizon, where the model is smart enough to make good synthetic data, everything will be fine,” Mr. Altman said. A.I. researchers have explored synthetic data for years. But building an A.I system that can train itself is easier said than done. A.I. models that learn from their own outputs can get caught in a loop where they reinforce their own quirks, mistakes and limitations. “The data these systems need is like a path through the jungle,” said Jeff Clune, a former OpenAI researcher who now teaches computer science at the University of British Columbia. “If they only train on synthetic data, they can get lost in the jungle.” To combat this, OpenAI and others are investigating how two different A.I. models might work together to generate synthetic data that is more useful and reliable. One system produces the data, while a second judges the information to separate the good from the bad. Researchers are divided on whether this method will work. A.I. executives are barreling ahead nonetheless. “It should be all right,” Mr. Altman said at the conference.  writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.  reports on technology and regulatory policy and is based in Washington D.C.

Mr. Zuckerberg demanded a solution, employees said. “The capability that Mark is looking for in the product is just something that we currently aren’t able to deliver,” one engineer said. While Meta operates giant social networks, it didn’t have troves of user posts at its disposal, two employees said. Many Facebook users had deleted their earlier posts, and the platform wasn’t where people wrote essay-type content, they said. Meta was also limited by privacy changes it introduced after   over sharing its users’ data with Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company. Mr. Zuckerberg said in   that the billions of publicly shared videos and photos on Facebook and Instagram are “greater than the Common Crawl data set.” During their recorded discussions, Meta executives talked about how they had hired contractors in Africa to aggregate summaries of fiction and nonfiction. The summaries included copyrighted content “because we have no way of not collecting that,” a manager said in one meeting. Meta’s executives said OpenAI seemed to have used copyrighted material without permission. It would take Meta too long to negotiate licenses with publishers, artists, musicians and the news industry, they said, according to the recordings. “The only thing that’s holding us back from being as good as ChatGPT is literally just data volume,” Nick Grudin, a vice president of global partnership and content, said in one meeting. OpenAI appeared to be taking copyrighted material and Meta could follow this “market precedent,” he added. Meta’s executives agreed to lean on a 2015 court decision involving the  , according to the recordings. In that case, Google was permitted to scan, digitize and catalog books in an online database after arguing that it had reproduced only snippets of the works online and had transformed the originals, which made it fair use. Using data to train A.I. systems, Meta’s lawyers said in their meetings, should similarly be fair use. At least two employees raised concerns about using intellectual property and not paying authors and other artists fairly or at all, according to the recordings. One employee recounted a separate discussion about copyrighted data with senior executives including Chris Cox, Meta’s chief product officer, and said no one in that meeting considered the ethics of using people’s creative works. OpenAI’s Mr. Altman had a plan to deal with the looming data shortage. Companies like his, he said at the May conference, would eventually train their A.I. on text generated by A.I. — otherwise known as synthetic data. Since an A.I. model can produce humanlike text, Mr. Altman and others have argued, the systems can create additional data to develop better versions of themselves. This would help developers build increasingly powerful technology and reduce their dependence on copyrighted data. “As long as you can get over the synthetic data event horizon, where the model is smart enough to make good synthetic data, everything will be fine,” Mr. Altman said. A.I. researchers have explored synthetic data for years. But building an A.I system that can train itself is easier said than done. A.I. models that learn from their own outputs can get caught in a loop where they reinforce their own quirks, mistakes and limitations. “The data these systems need is like a path through the jungle,” said Jeff Clune, a former OpenAI researcher who now teaches computer science at the University of British Columbia. “If they only train on synthetic data, they can get lost in the jungle.” To combat this, OpenAI and others are investigating how two different A.I. models might work together to generate synthetic data that is more useful and reliable. One system produces the data, while a second judges the information to separate the good from the bad. Researchers are divided on whether this method will work. A.I. executives are barreling ahead nonetheless. “It should be all right,” Mr. Altman said at the conference.  writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.  reports on technology and regulatory policy and is based in Washington D.C.

Middle East Crisis,"Iran’s leaders have vowed retribution for the killing of several top commanders in Damascus. Analysts fear that a reprisal could ignite a broader Mideast war. Israelis anxiously wondered on Saturday when and how Iran might respond to an Israeli strike in Syria that killed several senior Iranian commanders this week, as Iranian leaders vowed retribution and Israel   and mobilized additional air defense units. The Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on Monday killed Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s Quds Force, and several other commanders and senior officers. Israel has not publicly taken responsibility for the strike, but several Israeli officials   its involvement to The New York Times. Almost immediately, Iran’s leaders pledged that the strike would not go unpunished, a threat that was reiterated at funerals for several of the commanders and officers on Friday and Saturday in Iran, where large crowds of mourners and senior military officials gathered. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, responsible for the security of Iran’s borders, called an attack against Israel “a national demand” in a statement issued Saturday. And Brig. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, the commander in chief of Iran’s armed forces, said Saturday that Iran would “determine the time, place and method of the operation.” He added that the attack would be designed to inflict “maximum damage on the enemy to make it regret its action.” U.S. officials in Washington and the Middle East said on Friday that they were bracing for possible Iranian retaliation. On Thursday, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, held a “multi-front situational assessment” in tandem with Israel’s security chiefs, according to his office. Analysts have cautioned that while both sides probably want to avoid full-blown war involving Iran, any miscalculation could spill over and lead to a broader escalation. Israel has been trading fire with   for months, particularly the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 ignited the devastating war in Gaza. Israel and Iran have been locked in a  . Just this past December, Iran accused Israel of  , in a missile strike outside Damascus. A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was believed to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind the attack. The Israeli military said this past week that it had scrambled GPS signals “in order to neutralize threats,” without elaborating. The jamming threw a wrench into commuters’ trips across central Israel, telling some users that they were in neighboring Lebanon. Israeli combat soldiers expecting leave over the weekend have been ordered to remain deployed, the Israeli military said. And additional reserve units were called up to reinforce Israel’s air defense system. “We have raised the readiness of combat units as needed, wherever it was necessary; we have reinforced our defense systems; and we have planes ready for defense and prepared to act in a variety of scenarios,” the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said on Thursday.  and    Israel’s military said on Saturday that it had recovered the body of a man who was taken hostage from one of the communities hardest hit during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, almost six months to the day after his abduction. The man, Elad Katzir, 47, was killed in mid-January while being held in Gaza, an Israeli military official said in a news briefing on Saturday. The circumstances of his death could not be confirmed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the military operation. He had lived in Nir Oz, a kibbutz near the border with the Gaza Strip. Over a quarter of its more than 400 residents were either killed or abducted in the attack — including Mr. Katzir’s father, Avraham, who was killed, and mother, Hanna, who was also taken hostage, according to the Israeli military. Hanna Katzir was released in November as part of a brief cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas in which  . The return of Ms. Katzir, 76, stunned some of her family members, because Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group backed by Iran, had earlier claimed that she was dead. The families of the remaining 133 hostages held in Gaza have expressed mounting anger and despair, saying that the Israeli government is not doing enough to reach a deal for their release. On Saturday, Mr. Katzir’s sister, Carmit, denounced the Israeli government for not reaching an agreement in time to secure her brother’s release. “He could have been saved if there had been a deal in time,” she wrote of her brother on Facebook. “But our leadership are cowards, motivated by political considerations, and thus it did not happen.” About 100 hostages are still being held by Palestinian militants in the enclave, according to the Israeli authorities; over 30 others are now presumed dead. The Israeli military said that Mr. Katzir’s body had been recovered by troops in Khan Younis, a city in the southern part of Gaza where the Israeli army has been operating since December. Around 8 p.m. on Friday night, Israeli forces arrived in southern Khan Younis, isolated the area and excavated his body from where he was buried underground, the military official said. Forensic pathologists in Israel confirmed his identity, and officials then informed his family, the military said. The Israeli military’s assertion that he had been killed by his captors, Islamic Jihad, could not be verified. Islamic Jihad had released at least two videos of Mr. Katzir, a farmer who was born in Nir Oz. He was last seen in a video released in early January, in which he said he had been held for more than 90 days and described hearing on the radio of the death of a close friend from Nir Oz. Over the past several weeks, Israel and Hamas have resumed indirect negotiations over a possible cease-fire and the release of at least some hostages. Hamas said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday that a delegation of its leadership would travel to Cairo on Sunday for further negotiations. On Friday, President Biden sent messages to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar — who act as intermediaries between Hamas and Israel — urging them to increase pressure on Hamas to make a deal. He has pressed Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to do the same. Israeli leaders have insisted that continued “military pressure” on Hamas will force the group to come to the table. The families of many of the hostages, fearing that their loved ones could be killed by their captors or by errant Israeli fire, have demanded more immediate action. “Your story shouldn’t have ended like this,” Carmit Katzir wrote of her brother on Facebook on Saturday. “I’m sorry we couldn’t save you,” she wrote, adding, “I love you forever.”   Advertisement Elad Katzir, the Israeli hostage whose body was recovered and returned to Israel on Saturday, had long felt unprotected living along Israel’s border with Gaza. In  , after Palestinian rocket attacks led to a deadly three-week Israeli offensive against Hamas in Gaza, Mr. Katzir told a reporter that he had a nagging feeling. “I do not feel any victory,” Mr. Katzir said at the time, when the fighting had ended with a shaky cease-fire. “I still do not feel safe.” Mr. Katzir, 47, had deep roots in Nir Oz, the kibbutz in southern Israel where he was born and from which he was abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7. The wheat and potato fields there run right up to the Gaza border fence, within sight of the apartment buildings, water towers and minarets of the Palestinian village of Abasan just beyond it. The kibbutz’s residents grew up wary: During a drive through the fields during that 2009 visit, Mr. Katzir would stop the car only behind clumps of trees or bushes — cover in case of sniper fire. The tiny village was among the hardest-hit communities on Oct. 7, with about a quarter of its almost 400 residents killed or taken hostage. Among them were Mr. Katzir and also his father, who was killed, and his mother, who was taken to Gaza. She was released in November, one of   who were returned to Israel on a single day as part of a larger set of hostage releases. Dalit Katzenellenbogen, Mr. Katzir’s cousin, said then that she remained concerned for him and the other captives still in Gaza, and noted that Israeli soldiers were on the ground there. “I hope the war will end soon,” she added, “for the Israelis and for the Palestinians who do not support Hamas.” “We will have to learn how to keep living next to each other,” she added.   President Biden sent messages to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar urging them to increase pressure on Hamas to make a deal with Israel that would result in a temporary cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages held there, a senior administration official said on Friday. The messages to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, came as American and Israeli negotiators converge in Cairo this weekend for the next round of talks aimed at defusing the war that has consumed the Middle East for nearly six months. Tensions are particularly high in the region this weekend after   to avenge Israel’s killing of senior commanders and other officers of its elite Quds Force. U.S. officials in Washington and the Middle East said that they were bracing for possible Iranian retaliation for   on Monday in Damascus, Syria. U.S. military forces in the region and Israel’s military have been placed on heightened alert. The Egyptians and Qataris have served as intermediaries between Hamas and Israel, whose representatives do not speak directly, but repeated negotiating sessions have yet to yield a lasting deal. Mr. Biden reached out to the two Arab leaders to make clear that he is pressuring both sides, not just Israel, to forge an agreement. During a call on Thursday, Mr. Biden pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to make a concerted effort for a deal. The outlines of a possible agreement have been clear for months but the details have proven divisive. The terms would include a temporary cease-fire, the release of hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 assault on Israel and the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Among other points of dispute, according to American officials, are the ratio of prisoners to hostages, the sequence of the releases and the return of Palestinian civilians to northern Gaza. Leading the American delegation this weekend will be William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, and leading the Israelis will be David Barnea, the head of Mossad, the country’s spy agency. Along with Egyptian and Qatari officials, they are expected to sit down on Sunday to try to hash out a consensus. On Saturday, Hamas said in a statement on Telegram that a delegation of its leadership would travel to Cairo on Sunday for further negotiations. But the Palestinian armed group also said it was sticking to an earlier proposal that it submitted in mid-March, whose demands the Israeli prime minister’s office had dismissed as “ridiculous.” Aaron Boxerman  contributed reporting.   Reporting from Washington Advertisement Since the start of the war, Israel has limited aid entering the Gaza Strip to two tightly controlled border crossings: Kerem Shalom and Rafah, both in the south of the enclave. Aid officials have been pleading with Israel for months to add additional entry points, especially in the north, with the United Nations warning that Gaza was on the brink of famine. The news that Israel has agreed to open more route into Gaza was light on details. Here’s what we know: The Israeli government   that it would allow the “temporary delivery” of aid through the port of Ashdod in Israel and the Erez crossing, a checkpoint between Israel and northern Gaza. But it did not say when those new routes would open or how much aid could pass through them. COGAT, the Israeli agency that supervises aid deliveries into Gaza, did not respond to questions. Israel also said it would enable more aid from Jordan to pass through the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. The World Food Program said on Friday that it would seek to clarify with the Israeli authorities “their security and logistics arrangements so we can move swiftly to exploit any new opportunity to feed more Gazans as famine takes hold.” Timing is critical for northern Gaza, which has experienced some of the most dire shortages and where the United Nations has said the risk of famine looms largest. Aid groups say they have struggled to deliver supplies to the north, in part because of Israeli restrictions and widespread lawlessness. Truck convoys trying to reach the north from the southern crossings have sometimes been fired on, swarmed by desperate people or turned back by roadblocks. Moving aid through the Erez border crossing into northern Gaza is likely to present logistical hurdles because most aid for the enclave has been stored in El Arish in Egypt, on Gaza’s southern border. From El Arish, the trucks carrying aid have typically undergone security checks on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. The Erez crossing has been closed since Oct. 7, and it was not immediately clear what infrastructure might need to be put in place to facilitate any Israeli security checks on food and supplies there. Before the war, the crossing was used by pedestrians, not for goods.

During a call on Thursday, Mr. Biden pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to make a concerted effort for a deal. The outlines of a possible agreement have been clear for months but the details have proven divisive. The terms would include a temporary cease-fire, the release of hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 assault on Israel and the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Among other points of dispute, according to American officials, are the ratio of prisoners to hostages, the sequence of the releases and the return of Palestinian civilians to northern Gaza. Leading the American delegation this weekend will be William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, and leading the Israelis will be David Barnea, the head of Mossad, the country’s spy agency. Along with Egyptian and Qatari officials, they are expected to sit down on Sunday to try to hash out a consensus. On Saturday, Hamas said in a statement on Telegram that a delegation of its leadership would travel to Cairo on Sunday for further negotiations. But the Palestinian armed group also said it was sticking to an earlier proposal that it submitted in mid-March, whose demands the Israeli prime minister’s office had dismissed as “ridiculous.” Aaron Boxerman  contributed reporting.   Reporting from Washington Advertisement Since the start of the war, Israel has limited aid entering the Gaza Strip to two tightly controlled border crossings: Kerem Shalom and Rafah, both in the south of the enclave. Aid officials have been pleading with Israel for months to add additional entry points, especially in the north, with the United Nations warning that Gaza was on the brink of famine. The news that Israel has agreed to open more route into Gaza was light on details. Here’s what we know: The Israeli government   that it would allow the “temporary delivery” of aid through the port of Ashdod in Israel and the Erez crossing, a checkpoint between Israel and northern Gaza. But it did not say when those new routes would open or how much aid could pass through them. COGAT, the Israeli agency that supervises aid deliveries into Gaza, did not respond to questions. Israel also said it would enable more aid from Jordan to pass through the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. The World Food Program said on Friday that it would seek to clarify with the Israeli authorities “their security and logistics arrangements so we can move swiftly to exploit any new opportunity to feed more Gazans as famine takes hold.” Timing is critical for northern Gaza, which has experienced some of the most dire shortages and where the United Nations has said the risk of famine looms largest. Aid groups say they have struggled to deliver supplies to the north, in part because of Israeli restrictions and widespread lawlessness. Truck convoys trying to reach the north from the southern crossings have sometimes been fired on, swarmed by desperate people or turned back by roadblocks. Moving aid through the Erez border crossing into northern Gaza is likely to present logistical hurdles because most aid for the enclave has been stored in El Arish in Egypt, on Gaza’s southern border. From El Arish, the trucks carrying aid have typically undergone security checks on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. The Erez crossing has been closed since Oct. 7, and it was not immediately clear what infrastructure might need to be put in place to facilitate any Israeli security checks on food and supplies there. Before the war, the crossing was used by pedestrians, not for goods.

"Russia Pounds Kharkiv in Deadly Barrage, Straining Ukraine’s Defenses","Advertisement Supported by The latest assault on the eastern city killed at least six people, local authorities said. As Kyiv waits on American aid, Moscow has stepped up bombardments, including using modified “glide bombs.” Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine Russian rockets slammed into residential buildings in Kharkiv before dawn on Saturday, Ukrainian officials said, killing at least six people and injuring at least 11 more in the latest assault on Ukraine’s second-largest city. “Russian terror against Kharkiv continues,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a statement. “It’s crucial to strengthen the air defense for the Kharkiv region. And our partners can help us with this.” Ukraine’s air defenses have come increasingly under strain since American military support stopped flowing into the country more than six months ago, and future assistance remains uncertain amid  . Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, has hinted that he would soon bring   to a vote in the House, but has also said that he might tie the issue to unrelated matters like domestic energy policies that could complicate its passage. At the same time, Russia has replenished and expanded its stockpile of missiles, guided bombs and attack drones and is stepping up its bombardments across the country. Mr. Zelensky said this past week that “in March alone, Russian terrorists used over 400 missiles of various types, 600 Shahed drones and over 3,000 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine.” Kharkiv, second in population only to Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and only about 25 miles from the Russian border, has been particularly hard hit. Russian forces   in the first months of the war, which began in February 2022, and they were driven out of most of the Kharkiv region during   that fall. As Russia has stepped up its aerial bombardments of Kharkiv, it has for the first time deployed powerful guided bombs to hit the city. The use of the modified bombs represents a new and potentially deadly development against which Ukraine has little defense, Ukrainian officials and military analysts said. There are a number of variations of the weapons, known as glide bombs, but essentially they are powerful gravity bombs modified with a set of wings and guidance systems to allow them to be dropped by fighter-bombers out of the range of Ukrainian air-defense systems. More than 20,000 buildings have been destroyed in Kharkiv since Russia  . Ukrainian government officials estimate that it will cost more than $10 billion to rebuild everything that has already been destroyed. “Practically all critical energy infrastructure in Kharkiv is destroyed, and private infrastructure is also shattered,” Ihor Terekhov, the city’s mayor, said this past week. “More than 150,000 residents of Kharkiv are left homeless,” he added. In the most recent overnight attack, Russia hit residential neighborhoods with a barrage of S-300 missiles, which were fired from Russian territory and can reach Kharkiv in under a minute, Ukrainian officials said. Nine residential buildings, a kindergarten, a cafe and a gas station were among the buildings damaged, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv military administration, said in a statement. The attack came less than 48 hours after Russian drone strikes in Kharkiv on Thursday killed four civilians, including three emergency workers. The bombardments have coincided with a propaganda campaign by the Kremlin aimed at stoking panic in the city. “Russian propaganda is spreading fake messages among Kharkiv residents, allegedly from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, about the possible encirclement of Kharkiv in the near future with recommendations to leave the city,” the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said. “This information is not true,” the agency said. “The enemy does not currently have the resources to surround or capture Kharkiv.” Despite the daily attacks and blackouts, there has been no major exodus from the city, which has a population of 1.3 million. In recent months, Russia has leveraged air superiority to make tactical gains on the front. For instance, it has used hundreds of guided bombs to obliterate Ukrainian positions in Avdiivka before seizing the longtime stronghold in eastern Ukraine this year. Moscow appears to be seeking to replicate that strategy to weaken other Ukrainian fortifications across the front. Russia has also been working to increase the distance such bombs can fly, according to Ukrainian officials. The guided bombs used to target Kharkiv recently — which have been identified by Ukrainian officials as air-to-surface missiles — have been designed to travel more than 55 miles, allowing Russian warplanes to launch them with relative impunity from inside Russia, Ukrainian officials said. Once the bombs are unleashed, there is little Ukraine can do to shoot them out of the sky, so Kyiv is trying to find other ways to counter the threat. As part of that effort, Ukraine on Friday launched a complex drone assault targeting Russian warplanes at multiple airfields across Russia. A senior Ukrainian security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss continuing military operations, said that the drone assaults had destroyed at least six military aircraft and significantly damaged another eight. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that its air defenses had intercepted more than 50 drones aimed at targets across the country and made no mention of damage to planes. It was not possible to immediately verify the claims by either side, and there was no independent visual confirmation after the attack that would allow military analysts to assess the damage. However, the scale of the Ukrainian operation would be significant, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said on Friday night. “Ukraine’s ability to strike four separate air bases in one strike series represents a notable inflection in the capabilities that Ukrainian forces are employing in their campaign against Russian military infrastructure, critical infrastructure, and strategic industries within Russia,” the analysts wrote.

As Russia has stepped up its aerial bombardments of Kharkiv, it has for the first time deployed powerful guided bombs to hit the city. The use of the modified bombs represents a new and potentially deadly development against which Ukraine has little defense, Ukrainian officials and military analysts said. There are a number of variations of the weapons, known as glide bombs, but essentially they are powerful gravity bombs modified with a set of wings and guidance systems to allow them to be dropped by fighter-bombers out of the range of Ukrainian air-defense systems. More than 20,000 buildings have been destroyed in Kharkiv since Russia  . Ukrainian government officials estimate that it will cost more than $10 billion to rebuild everything that has already been destroyed. “Practically all critical energy infrastructure in Kharkiv is destroyed, and private infrastructure is also shattered,” Ihor Terekhov, the city’s mayor, said this past week. “More than 150,000 residents of Kharkiv are left homeless,” he added. In the most recent overnight attack, Russia hit residential neighborhoods with a barrage of S-300 missiles, which were fired from Russian territory and can reach Kharkiv in under a minute, Ukrainian officials said. Nine residential buildings, a kindergarten, a cafe and a gas station were among the buildings damaged, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv military administration, said in a statement. The attack came less than 48 hours after Russian drone strikes in Kharkiv on Thursday killed four civilians, including three emergency workers. The bombardments have coincided with a propaganda campaign by the Kremlin aimed at stoking panic in the city. “Russian propaganda is spreading fake messages among Kharkiv residents, allegedly from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, about the possible encirclement of Kharkiv in the near future with recommendations to leave the city,” the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said. “This information is not true,” the agency said. “The enemy does not currently have the resources to surround or capture Kharkiv.” Despite the daily attacks and blackouts, there has been no major exodus from the city, which has a population of 1.3 million. In recent months, Russia has leveraged air superiority to make tactical gains on the front. For instance, it has used hundreds of guided bombs to obliterate Ukrainian positions in Avdiivka before seizing the longtime stronghold in eastern Ukraine this year. Moscow appears to be seeking to replicate that strategy to weaken other Ukrainian fortifications across the front. Russia has also been working to increase the distance such bombs can fly, according to Ukrainian officials. The guided bombs used to target Kharkiv recently — which have been identified by Ukrainian officials as air-to-surface missiles — have been designed to travel more than 55 miles, allowing Russian warplanes to launch them with relative impunity from inside Russia, Ukrainian officials said. Once the bombs are unleashed, there is little Ukraine can do to shoot them out of the sky, so Kyiv is trying to find other ways to counter the threat. As part of that effort, Ukraine on Friday launched a complex drone assault targeting Russian warplanes at multiple airfields across Russia. A senior Ukrainian security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss continuing military operations, said that the drone assaults had destroyed at least six military aircraft and significantly damaged another eight. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that its air defenses had intercepted more than 50 drones aimed at targets across the country and made no mention of damage to planes. It was not possible to immediately verify the claims by either side, and there was no independent visual confirmation after the attack that would allow military analysts to assess the damage. However, the scale of the Ukrainian operation would be significant, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said on Friday night. “Ukraine’s ability to strike four separate air bases in one strike series represents a notable inflection in the capabilities that Ukrainian forces are employing in their campaign against Russian military infrastructure, critical infrastructure, and strategic industries within Russia,” the analysts wrote.

A Frozen Pond and a New Way to Experience an Ancient Jewish Ritual in Maine,"Advertisement Supported by ACROSS THE COUNTRY Students from Colby College helped harvest ice from a pond for a new mikvah, or ritual bath, at a synagogue in Waterville. WHY WE’RE HERE Reporting from Waterville and Strong, Maine Standing on a frozen pond in western Maine one Sunday morning last month, wearing L.L. Bean boots and a hooded sweatshirt, Rabbi Rachel Isaacs paused to consecrate the ice beneath her feet before she commandeered it for a higher purpose. “Blessed are you, God, who has brought us to this moment!” the rabbi belted out. Austin Thorndike, a member of her congregation at Beth Israel Synagogue in Waterville, stood beside her. When the prayer was over, he fired up his chain saw and bent to dip it into the hard surface of the pond, deftly making four quick cuts to free a slick, white, cartoon-perfect block of ice. The ice was destined for a highly unusual end. As the blocks multiplied, a crew of Colby College student athletes sprang into action, pulling them from the pond, pushing them to shore and swiftly loading them into waiting trucks. Next, the frozen cargo would be driven 40 miles to the synagogue, where the students would carry it to the basement. There, they would wipe each block clean with a cloth, stack it in the congregation’s brand-new mikvah, and leave it to melt. The mikvah — a traditional Jewish bath used in rites of renewal and purification for thousands of years — would elevate this small synagogue in Waterville, a city of 16,000, to a destination for people from across Maine seeking a symbolic fresh start. But its creation, in accordance with ancient Jewish law, was not as simple as turning on a tap. To be kosher, a new mikvah must be initiated with “living water,” taken straight from nature. Harvesting ice from a pond was not the easiest approach. (Collecting rainwater is more common.) But the woodsy, wintry plan felt right for Maine, participants said. So did the involvement of Colby students, some of them Jewish and some not. In a rural state where a small Jewish population often needs grit, ingenuity and strong relationships to achieve its goals, the small liberal arts college and the small Waterville synagogue have long been closely tied. Friday night dinners at Beth Israel, hosted by Colby Hillel, the Jewish organization on campus, reliably serve 30 to 40 students, a mix of practicing Jews, their non-Jewish friends and others drawn to the cozy routine. It was natural, then, for Rabbi Isaacs to seek ice-hauling help from students at Colby, where she is an assistant professor of Jewish studies and director of the college’s Center for Small Town Jewish Life. Andrew Postal, a sophomore from Andover, Mass., brought fellow rugby players to the frozen pond, while Caitlin Kincaid, a senior from Colorado Springs, Colo., enlisted 10 members of the Colby Woodsmen Team, skilled in sawing wood and swinging axes. “Upper body strength is something we have in abundance at Colby,” Rabbi Isaacs said. At many synagogues, particularly Orthodox ones, the mikvah is reserved for strictly traditional uses, including conversion to Judaism and symbolic cleansing by women after menstruation. The new Waterville mikvah will be one of a few dozen across the country, and the only one in Maine, that is instead “open” —   more inclusive, by using it to observe a more diverse array of milestones, like a college graduation  . Students recruited by the rabbi were eager to pitch in, even if they did not know what a mikvah was before she explained it. “Everyone was like, ‘Yeah! The synagogue needs ice!’” said Will Whitman, 22, a senior rugby player who had quickly signed on to help. “Then we were like, ‘Wait — why does the synagogue need ice?’” Stepping out onto the pond, their boots fortified with strap-on ice cleats, the students and other volunteers took turns gripping the heavy, freshly cut blocks with a pair of oversized log tongs and pulling them from the water. “It’s like the claw game,” said Alex Kimmel, 31, a member of a Jewish congregation in Augusta as a block slipped out of her grasp and splashed back into the pond. Others stood back and marveled at the scene — the small, spring-fed pond ringed by birch and pine; the fine mist rising from the melting snow; the students scooting ice blocks onto a plastic sled, which they dragged up a steep ridge of snow to the waiting trucks. More than one onlooker was reminded of   the Disney film set in frosty Arendelle. To plan the operation, Rabbi Isaacs, 41, had leaned on the expertise of Mr. Thorndike, 35, an arborist and native Mainer who had offered the ice from a pond on his family’s land. (“I’m from the Jersey Shore,” Rabbi Isaacs said. “I trust the Maine-ness of my congregation.”) Mr. Thorndike’s own conversion to Judaism, in 2020, helped spur the plan to build an in-house mikvah at Beth Israel. An immersion in living water is needed to complete the conversion process, but the nearest mikvah, about 60 miles away in Bangor, was closed at the time because of the pandemic. Eager to seal the deal, Mr. Thorndike had agreed to immerse himself in a Maine lake instead — in October. “To be kosher, it has to be three full submersions, and you can’t be touching anything, so I was treading water,” he said. “It was like Navy SEAL training.” Watching him suffer, the rabbi resolved to engineer a less painful option. “His teeth were chattering so much he could barely say the blessing,” she recalled.  Conversions have occurred with increasing frequency since Rabbi Isaacs arrived to lead Beth Israel. The congregation, founded in 1902, had dwindled to fewer than 20 families by the time she became rabbi in 2011. It has since rebounded to 70. More than 20 percent of its current members are “Jews by choice” who were not raised in the religion — growth that Rabbi Isaacs sees as critical to her synagogue’s future, “and to the future of small-town Jewish life” across America.  The synagogue enlisted other Jewish congregations in Maine, which will also use the mikvah, to help pay for its ongoing maintenance. “You might expect to see this in Boston or New York, but to have it here, in a small college town, is extraordinary,” said Julie Childers, director of the Mayyim Hayyim mikvah in Newton, Mass. “Sometimes it’s small towns where things like this can happen.” Ms. Childers, who traveled to Maine for the ice harvest, oversees   (the plural of mikvah), providing guidance on construction, training sessions and text for ceremonies, among other services. Rabbi Isaacs — who said she thinks of herself as “Waterville’s rabbi,” not just Beth Israel’s — will welcome non-Jews into the mikvah too, in keeping with the synagogue’s diverse relationships. “It’s a venue for deepening one’s relationship with spirituality, for beginning again,” she said. “There aren’t many venues for that kind of renewal.” With the Colby students keeping a brisk pace, shedding layers of clothing as they worked, the ice was cut and ready for transport in under an hour. Whisked through the woods and villages of western Maine — Rabbi Isaacs drove 10 of the 60 blocks herself in her pickup truck — the ice arrived at the synagogue just after noon. It melted rapidly in the 60-degree room, dripping audibly into the deep basin and slowly filling it in the days that followed. After some water evaporated, Mr. Thorndike had to deliver a few more blocks, to ensure the mikvah contained the ton of living water required by Jewish law. But by the middle of March, the mikvah was ready. On a Sunday afternoon two weeks after the ice harvest, Lucia Greene, 18, a Colby student, became the first to complete her conversion to Judaism in the mikvah, descending its seven steps — representing the seven days of creation described in the Torah — and immersing herself within its filtered, heated waters. The milestone felt surreal, she said — and also “too soon,” even after nearly two years of preparation. “But I’d been feeling Jewish for a while,” she said. “And when that’s how you feel, it’s time to go into the mikvah.”  is the lead reporter covering New England for The Times.

Why Time Is Running Out Across the Maldives’ Lovely Little Islands,"Global tourism brought a modern economy to the country’s thousand islands. For many Maldivians, the teeming capital beckons. Global tourism brought a modern economy to the country’s thousand islands. For many Maldivians, the teeming capital beckons. Supported by  and  Reporting from Malé, its nearby islands and Nolhivaranfaru in the Maldives To live in the Maldives is to live in one of two worlds. Either you belong to the capital — Malé, a micro-Manhattan in the Indian Ocean — or you are out in “the islands,” among the quietest and most remote villages this side of the Arctic tundra. It is in these places — far from the archipelago’s walled-garden resort atolls, where no Maldivians actually dwell — that the country is picking between two visions of its future, like much of the rest of Asia, but more so. The outer islands are steadily depopulating, as the appeal of making a life through tuna fishing and coconut farming along their crushed-coral seashores shrinks. The splendid isolation may be what attracts visitors, but it seems incompatible with islanders’ aspirations in a nation modernized by global tourism. As Maldivians give up on island life, the government feels compelled to keep building up Malé, the country’s one real city. But Malé is already pressed up hard against the limits of human habitation. By some measures, it is the most densely populated island on earth, with over a third of the country’s 520,000 people on a landmass that can be crossed by foot in about 20 minutes. If more Maldivians are going to move there, its physical structure will need to be radically reworked. In the meantime, it is sprawling outward wherever it can: The government is surrounding Malé with sea bridges to artificial islands packed with housing  . On Jan. 22, President Mohamed Muizzu announced his otherworldly vision for an undersea tunnel between Malé proper and a land-reclamation project where Chinese investors will help build 65,000 housing units on what is now barely a sandbar. Mr. Muizzu, a civil engineer by training, said the tunnel would “provide beautiful views of the sea” as commuters passed through it. (Feasibility to be determined.) Humay Ghafoor, a researcher who campaigns against environmental degradation, said that “nobody does any assessments” before commissioning “massive infrastructure” projects. This allows an airport, for instance, to be built over a mangrove, destroying a whole island’s freshwater supply. The Maldives consists of a thousand islands stretched along a 550-mile axis, each one a bit of exposed coral that grew from the rims of a prehistoric range of undersea volcanoes. These form rings called atolls — a word that comes to English from the native Dhivehi language. Most of the 188 inhabited islands have fewer than 1,000 residents. The resorts — those airy villas floating over turquoise seas — are all on technically “uninhabited” islands. The guests are foreign, and most of the staff is, too, mainly from India and Bangladesh. In some ways, the resorts are like offshore oil rigs, pumping out nearly all of the country’s income. By design, they are divorced from Maldivian culture and abstracted from their South Asian location. CHINA PAKISTAN NEPAL New Delhi INDIA Arabian Sea Bay of Bengal Kochi Nolhivaranfaru SRI  LANKA Maavaidhoo Malé MALDIVEs Hulhumalé Malé Villingili 300 MILES By The New York Times The typical inhabited island is likewise rich in sunshine and warmth and has access to a shallow lagoon, palm trees and maybe a mangrove forest. The inhabitants are highly literate, many are English-speaking and they are connected to the rest of the world by the internet, mobile data and long ferry routes. Their traditions survive, still. Perhaps every island except Malé has a holhuashi, a covered seating platform at its harbor, sometimes circled by hanging woven chairs. Men gather to rest at midday and exchange gossip. There is little doubt that climate change will eventually bring doom to this country, most of which is just a meter or two above sea level. But that catastrophe is thought to be a century or more away. Instead, Maldivians are leaving the islands for the sake of their children, looking to Malé and the world beyond. When it comes to education and health care, there is no substitute for city life. Nolhivaranfaru, a fishhook-shaped bit of powdery white sand, with a green and fertile core between its beaches, is like many of the Maldives’ inhabited islands. Flowering frangipani stand over an Islamic cemetery near its piers, centered around a centuries-old shrine to an Arab pilgrim. It takes 25 minutes by speedboat to reach the nearest landmass and two airplanes from there to get to neighboring India. That is a journey that Maryam Asima, a 30-year-old mother of twins, made at great cost and personal hardship. She and her husband, the captain of a tourist yacht that docks 175 miles away, near Malé, had been unable to conceive. Two years ago, Ms. Asima and her sister, who was in a similar position, traveled to Kochi, India, a city of 2.1 million, where they made do on their own during 11 months of IVF treatment. Health care remains rudimentary even on the better connected of the outer islands. Staff at the local clinic scoff at the idea of someday providing IVF. They say quietly that even most emergency care is beyond them: Any patient who needs a ventilator must be flown hundreds of miles away. Ms. Asima, now back on the island with her 6-month-old twins, says she is satisfied with the results of her ordeal. Her sister has given her a nephew, too. With her encouragement, two other women from the island have become pregnant in the same way. The government has started offering $500 subsidies and the possibility of free air travel for families that need to go abroad for IVF. She likes the “home feeling” of her island and hopes to send her children to school there, even if they need to travel to a nearby island to see a pediatrician. But this is not her first home: Ms. Asima was born on an even smaller island, Maavaidhoo, which was abandoned after being swamped by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. Many Maldivians have been on the move for a generation or more, leaving smaller communities for larger ones. More than anywhere else, those who can afford it go to Malé. Thirty years ago, it was not unusual for families to send unaccompanied minors on long ferry journeys, of 20 hours or more, to live in Malé. They would stay with distant relatives or even strangers and work as pint-size housekeepers to pay for their room and board as they attended one of the country’s better schools. Island families still send their children to study in Malé, but usually now they travel as teenagers; better primary schooling is available even in remote places. The cramped conditions of the capital are the first challenge they face. A compact grid of streets jams pedestrians, motorbikes, workshops and luxury perfumers together like a miniature version of central Hong Kong. One-bedroom apartments rent for five times the starting salary of a government office worker. Ajuvad, a nervous, soft-spoken 23-year-old, came to Malé at 16 to join his older siblings, six people crammed into three bedrooms. They are all professionals, with jobs as teachers and technicians. But they were raised in another world, a 36-hour ferry ride away. There, the beach was a five-minute walk away with no roads and no motorbikes, and their home was a four-bedroom house that their father, a fisherman, built himself. Their mother made fish paste and sold it to neighbors. Ajuvad, who asked that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, remembers the transition as being “quite a challenge.” Having to live without his parents, and without an inch of space to study alone in quiet, he said, “I thought my world had collapsed.” Ahmed Abbas, a 39-year-old hardware salesman, had an easier time moving into Malé’s urban sprawl from a distant southern island 12 years ago. His family of six shares a two-bedroom apartment in a complex built by Chinese developers, across a sea bridge from the city proper.

Election Updates: Trump looks to keep pace with Biden in the money race with high-dollar Florida event.,"Authorities in Vermont have opened an arson investigation into a   outside the Burlington office of Senator Bernie Sanders, who was not there at the time. They said that they were searching for a man who sprayed an “apparent accelerant” on the entrance door to the third-floor office, which sustained water damage from the sprinkler system. Donald Trump is set to attend a major fund-raiser tonight in Palm Beach, Fla., that he and his campaign hope will help them close a major cash gap they face against the Biden campaign. The event, hosted by a hedge fund billionaire, is expected to raise more than $30 million, according to two people involved in the planning. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign again sought to clean up the candidate’s statements about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, retracting a false claim made on Friday that the rioters “carried no weapons” while leaving in place other false claims that downplayed the attack’s severity. It was the second day in a row that the Kennedy campaign had to retract a statement addressing the riot. Former President Donald J. Trump will attend a high-dollar fund-raising dinner in Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday night hosted by John Paulson, a hedge-fund billionaire who was   to back Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. The dinner is expected to raise at least $25 million for a new joint fund-raising account for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, the Republican National Committee and roughly 40 state parties. Some top donors have voiced concerns about paying into that account, fearing that their contributions could be used to   in light of the dozens of felony counts he faces in four separate criminal cases. President Biden, who has spent much of the week  , continues to hold a commanding financial advantage over Mr. Trump. The president and the Democrats   — more than double what Mr. Trump reported in his coffers this week. Tonight’s extravagant fund-raiser — with individual tickets selling for up to $814,600 — is just one piece of Mr. Trump’s efforts to try to catch the president in the money race even as many   leading Mr. Biden in key battleground states. Big donors are signing checks at what feels like a turning point in the presidential race. Both major candidates have clinched their parties’ nominations, and the field of third-party and independent candidates is shaping up now that No Labels, the centrist organization that had hoped to field its own ticket,  . Chief among those candidates is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who gained political prominence from his promotion of vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories about the government. Mr. Kennedy typically   when surveys include him, but he is backed by a well-funded super PAC and recently took on  . Mr. Biden will be back on the campaign trail on Monday, traveling to Madison, Wis., to  . Reporting from Washington President Biden continued to build on his commanding financial advantage over former President Donald J. Trump, raising more than $90 million in March together with the Democratic Party and affiliated committees, his campaign said. Mr. Biden, the party and their shared accounts now have $192 million on hand going into April, according to his campaign — more than double what Mr. Trump reported in his coffers this week. Since Mr. Biden began his re-election bid, 1.6 million Americans have donated money to him, his campaign said, reflecting a broad base of financial support. These are “real investments that real Americans are making into this campaign,” said Rufus Gifford, the Biden campaign’s finance chair. Mr. Gifford suggested that the campaign’s fund-raising strength was more important than polls that have   Mr. Biden trailing Mr. Trump. “You can’t lie about the numbers,” Mr. Gifford said. “They’re not theoretical. It’s not a random poll that is just one moment in time.” The president’s numbers were fueled by a $26 million haul from a fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall in New York City that  . His campaign also said he raised $10 million in the 24 hours after his State of the Union address on March 7. Mr. Trump has increased the pace of his own fund-raising,   at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. His campaign said it and the Republican National Committee raised $65.6 million in March, Mr. Trump’s   so far. Trump campaign aides say they plan to out-raise Mr. Biden’s three-president bash with a major fund-raiser of their own on Saturday in Palm Beach. But Mr. Biden’s prodigious March may take some of the wind out of Mr. Trump’s sails. “We’ve got all the momentum now, and I think you’re going to continue to see it,” said Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-chair of the Biden campaign. “These are spectacular outcomes for the campaign and a vote of confidence for the president and vice president.” Of course, having the most money does not guarantee victory. And there are signs that Mr. Trump may continue to up his fund-raising. March was the first month that Mr. Trump, now his party’s presumptive nominee, started to raise money in joint accounts with the R.N.C. Those accounts can accept far larger donations than Mr. Trump was allowed to in the primary. Mr. Trump, the R.N.C. and their shared accounts roughly doubled their available cash on hand going into April. That figure now stands at $93.1 million, although it is still far less than Mr. Biden and the Democrats. Shane Goldmacher  and  Reid J. Epstein  contributed reporting. The authorities in Vermont said they were searching for a man who started a fire outside Senator Bernie Sanders’s office in Burlington on Friday morning. The unidentified man walked into the vestibule of Senator Sanders’s office and sprayed an “apparent accelerant” on the entrance door to the third-floor office, before lighting the accelerant and fleeing, the Burlington Police Department said in a statement. It was unclear exactly what the man sprayed on the door. “A significant fire engulfed the door and part of the vestibule,” which prevented staff members who were working inside the office from exiting, the Police Department said. The building’s sprinkler system activated, which mostly put out the fire before firefighters arrived around 10:45 a.m., the Police Department said. The Burlington Fire Department said that the door to the senator’s office “sustained moderate” damage from the fire, and that the third floor of the building and the floors below it also had water damage. No injuries were reported. Senator Sanders, independent of Vermont, was not at the office at the time of the fire, his office said in a statement. Investigators with the Vermont State Police determined that the fire was an act of arson. The authorities had not concluded a motive. The Police Department released a photo from surveillance footage of the man who started the fire. In the photo, he is wearing a black jacket, dark-colored pants, white sneakers and an orange beanie. Kathryn Van Haste, the Vermont state director for Senator Sanders, said in a statement, “We are grateful to the Burlington Fire and Police Departments who responded immediately today to a fire incident that took place in our office building.” The United States Capitol Police and the Senate sergeant-at-arms were working with local authorities in Burlington investigating the fire, Ms. Van Haste said. Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak of Burlington said in a statement that she was “relieved to hear that everyone made it out safely.” For the second time in just over 24 hours, the independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has backpedaled after making claims that sympathized with the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. After falsely asserting in a statement on Friday that the “protesters carried no weapons” during the attack, Mr. Kennedy issued a retraction on his campaign website later in the day acknowledging that he had been wrong. “My understanding that none of the Jan. 6 rioters who invaded the Capitol were carrying firearms was incorrect,” he said. “Several have been convicted of carrying firearms into the Capitol building. Others assaulted Capitol Police with pepper spray, bludgeons and other makeshift weapons.” Mr. Kennedy had been sowing doubt about whether the Capitol attack — which occurred while Congress was certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election — was a “true insurrection.” In his retraction, he sought to further clean up his earlier statements. “This behavior is inexcusable,” he said of the violence. “I have never minimized or dismissed the seriousness of the riot or any crime committed on that day.” Mr. Kennedy’s campaign put itself in a similar predicament on Thursday, when an email to supporters suggested that the Jan. 6 defendants were political prisoners and compared them to Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, and Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who leaked details about U.S. surveillance programs. The email called for the release of Mr. Assange, who has been in prison in Britain while fighting his extradition to the United States. “The Brits want to make sure our government doesn’t kill Assange,” the email said. “This is the reality that every American Citizen faces – from Ed Snowden, to Julian Assange to the J6 activists sitting in a Washington DC jail cell stripped of their Constitutional liberties.” Later on Thursday, the campaign distanced itself from the comparison, saying in a statement that it was an “error” and did not reflect Mr. Kennedy’s views. “It was inserted by a new marketing contractor and slipped through the normal approval process,” the campaign said. “The campaign has terminated its contract with this vendor.” When asked on Saturday about its repeated backtracking in recent days, the campaign did not offer further comment.

Biden Waves His First-Term Résumé at a Skeptical America,"Advertisement Supported by With increasing urgency, the president is trying to impress upon voters that he has accomplished quite a bit — even if they don’t see it in their lives yet. Reporting from Washington President Biden is discovering that passing one of the most ambitious legislative agendas in recent American history may have been the easy part. Persuading Americans that he deserves a second term may be far more difficult. Confronting low approval ratings and a neck-and-neck race against former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden is now racing to tell voters about his accomplishments, in ways big and small. Road signs that promote his legislation are going up at construction projects financed by his   and at factories where jobs are being created by his  . Mr. Biden has affixed his name to emails telling Americans with student debt that their loans were being forgiven. And he is traveling to battleground states to sit down with voters who have benefited from his policies. Democrats traditionally have been “the party of the abstract, and we need to be the party that humanizes things,” said Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, a Biden ally who believes the president has the skill set to do just that. “He personally is so good at this, putting his arm — figuratively and literally — around the American people and saying, ‘Hey, listen, I feel your pain.’” But Mr. Biden faces a host of challenges in reaping the credit that he feels he deserves as he seeks re-election to the White House. Polling shows that a majority of Americans   of his job performance. Many Americans say   from the policies of Mr. Trump. Most concerning for Mr. Biden, his support remains underwhelming among key parts of the Democratic coalition, including Black and Hispanic Americans and younger voters — the people many of his efforts were designed to help. Some of that negativity can be attributed to the 81-year-old president’s age,   and   of Mr. Trump, a phenomenon that is common after presidents leave office. The war in Gaza has depressed enthusiasm among Democrats, too. Mr. Biden, however, may also be hampered by the very nature of his major legislation, which is meant to achieve transformational and long-term goals like rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure, combating climate change and reinvigorating manufacturing. Problems of that magnitude cannot be solved instantly — or even before voters go to the polls in November. Without immediate results, ambitious legislation can be harder to market. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official in the Clinton White House, said Mr. Biden’s approach resembled that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who enacted programs like Social Security that fundamentally altered the fabric of American life. “Biden is a different generation in that respect. For him, policy is about legacy, as opposed to ‘What will it do for me tomorrow?’” Ms. Kamarck said. “Now, it certainly does pose political issues because people don’t see the results. But I think most people understand that climate change, you don’t solve it overnight.” In contrast, Mr. Trump brought about more tangible changes when he was in office, like   and  . Although those measures do not necessarily poll well among the broader electorate, they could allow him to drive turnout among Republicans at a time when Mr. Biden is struggling to energize his own base. Of course, Mr. Biden’s investments in infrastructure and manufacturing are already creating jobs. And he has championed policies with more immediate effects, too, such as capping insulin prices for older people, forgiving some student loan debt and increasing tax subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance. His campaign message has increasingly focused on expanding many of those initiatives to benefit more Americans. At his State of the Union address, Mr. Biden ran through a list of ways he would use a second term to build on the achievements of his first. “There’s more to do to make sure you’re feeling the benefits of all we’re doing,” Mr. Biden said, promising, in one example, to broaden a $35 cap on insulin beyond older people. “Now I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it — everyone,” he said. In order to sell his message, the Biden campaign plans to lean on the fund-raising advantage it has built over Mr. Trump’s operation, and contrast his record with Mr. Trump’s. In March, the campaign announced   in battleground states. “The way that you sell things during campaigns is you go on TV and you tell people about it,” said Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who served as Mr. Biden’s   and is now a co-chairman of his campaign. “You show stories about the real-life people who you are impacting.” Mr. Biden has lately displayed a more personal touch in trying to connect with voters and illustrate how his presidency is changing their lives, particularly in battleground states. In Michigan, he showed off his   with a Black pastor and his son. In North Carolina, he   with a former school principal who had his student loans forgiven. “We’re looking for ways to make it bite-sized and memorable and driven through the American people telling their story and what this means to them,” said Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director. Last month, during a trip to the Philadelphia suburbs, Mr. Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, visited the home of Jack Cunicelli, whose family’s cafe and grocery businesses stayed afloat through the pandemic thanks to aid from Mr. Biden’s Covid-19 relief packages. At the family’s kitchen table, they shared margherita and spinach-ricotta pizza from one of the Cunicellis’ stores. Dr. Biden went out back to help feed the family chickens. Mr. Biden opened up about the loss of his son Beau Biden. “It felt like family and it felt so natural and normal and they were so disarming,” Mr. Cunicelli recounted in an interview. “And we just made so many connections.” “I wish everyone got to have that experience,” he added. But few voters got an up-close view of the sit-down, which lasted more than an hour. Although Mr. Cunicelli later did interviews with local news outlets and the Biden campaign posted photos and videos of the meeting, no reporters were allowed to accompany the president into the family’s home. Instead, the Biden campaign has used the visits to reach Americans on social media. For instance, it produced a video of the president’s meeting with the former principal in North Carolina that has been   on TikTok. Although some polls and consumer survey sentiments show that Americans are starting to feel better about the economy, Mr. Biden is still finding it tough to break through to voters. In Milwaukee last month, he visited the site of a $36.6 million road improvement project that will try to repair the destructive legacy of a highway routed through African American neighborhoods in the 1960s. It is scheduled to finish in 2029 — after Mr. Biden would have completed a second term. A sign at the construction site advertised the president’s role, saying the improvements were being financed by “President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.” “Those are President Biden’s fingerprints all over our city every single day,” Mayor Cavalier Johnson of Milwaukee, a Democrat, said in an interview. “Those are his policies.” But two weeks later, the sign was nowhere to be seen and several residents said they did not know that Mr. Biden’s legislation had paid for the project. Carlos Gonzalez-Martinez, a public health worker in the neighborhood, said he was still trying to decide whether to vote for Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump. Mr. Gonzalez-Martinez, 27, suggested that he was for the moment paying attention to more pressing matters, with the election still months away. “I’m chilling in my little bubble,” he said. “I’m paying my bills.” Tom Kertscher and  Reid J.

"Sickened by U.S. Nuclear Program, Communities Turn to Congress for Aid","In St. Louis and around the country, people harmed by the drive for an atomic bomb have been shut out of a federal law enacted to help such victims. Supported by Catie Edmondson, who covers Congress, surveyed St. Louis’s radioactive contamination from three sites, including the banks of Coldwater Creek. When Diane Scheig’s father, Bill, came home from work at the Mallinckrodt factory in St. Louis, he would strip down in their garage and hand his clothes to her mother to immediately wash, not daring to contaminate the house with the residue of his labors. Mr. Scheig, an ironworker who helped build the city’s famous arch, never told their family exactly what he was doing at the plant, where scientists first began processing uranium for the Manhattan Project in 1942. But by the age of 49, he had developed kidney cancer, lost his ability to walk, and died. Decades later, Diane’s older sister Sheryle, who years earlier had given birth to a baby boy born with a softball-sized tumor in his stomach, died of brain and lung cancer at 54. Her neighbor two doors down died of appendix cancer at 49. So many of her classmates have died of cancer that a large round table covered with their pictures is now a staple of her high school reunions. “I know for myself, I was thankful when I passed the age of 49,” Ms. Scheig said. “And I was thankful when I passed the age of 54.” The Mallinckrodt plant processed the uranium that allowed scientists at the University of Chicago to produce the first man-made controlled nuclear reaction, paving the way for the first atomic bomb. But the factory — and the program it served — left another legacy: A plague of cancer, autoimmune diseases and other mysterious illnesses has ripped through generations of families like Ms. Scheig’s in St. Louis, and other communities across the country that were exposed to the materials used to power the nuclear arms race. Now Congress is working on legislation that would allow people harmed by the program but so far shut out of a federal law enacted to aid its victims — including in New Mexico, Arizona, Tennessee and Washington state — to receive federal compensation. In the 1940s, as workers churned out 50,000 tons of uranium to feed the nation’s nascent atomic arsenal, the factory was also spitting out heaps of nuclear waste. Over the next several decades, hundreds of thousands of tons of radioactive waste stored in open steel drums were hauled and dumped across the city. The waste seeped into large swaths of soil, including on land that later became ball fields. And it drained into Coldwater Creek, a tributary that snakes through the metropolitan area for 19 miles through backyards and public parks where children play and catch crayfish. In heavy storms, the creek routinely floods. There are similar stories across the country, among the Navajo workers in New Mexico and Arizona who were sent into mines with a bucket and a shovel to dig up uranium and were never told about the dangers; the children of workers at uranium processing plants in Tennessee and Washington state; and the downwinders across the Southwest who breathed in the fallout from the mushroom clouds of aboveground tests. None of those communities qualify for aid under the only federal law to compensate civilians who sustained serious illnesses from the nation’s nuclear weapons program. Passed in 1990, that statute was narrowly constructed to help some uranium miners and a handful of communities who were present for aboveground testing. Claimants, who can include children or grandchildren of those who would have benefited from the program but have since died, receive a one-time payment of $50,000 to $100,000. The Senate last month   led by Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Senator Ben Ray Luján, Democrat of New Mexico, that would update and dramatically expand the law to include thousands of new participants, including Missouri families like the Scheigs. If Congress does not pass the bill before June, the law will expire altogether, shuttering the fund for those who are currently eligible and cutting off access to cancer screening clinics in neighborhoods that have been hit hard by radioactive exposure and rely on federal money to continue operating. To read their legislation is to visualize a map of the physical and psychic toll the nation’s nuclear weapons’ legacy has seared into communities across the country, years after the first atomic test at Los Alamos. “It speaks to the enormity of the burden,” Mr. Hawley, a conservative Republican who is up for re-election this year, said in an interview. “It speaks to the heroism of these people who, for 50-plus years in almost all these cases, have borne the burden themselves. Some of my colleagues complained about the cost. Well, who do they think is bearing the cost now?” For years, momentum to expand the nuclear compensation program had sputtered along in fits and starts on Capitol Hill, adopted by various lawmakers who inched it forward but were not able to secure a vote in the House or Senate. But it got a shot in the arm when Mr. Hawley took up the issue, working with Mr. Luján to draft legislation and using his perch on the Armed Services Committee to attach it to the annual defense policy bill. When the measure was   of the legislation after Republicans objected to its hefty price tag, which congressional scorekeepers estimated could hit $140 billion, the senators went back to the drawing board. Cutting out expansive new provisions that would have forced the federal government to cover victims’ medical fees, Mr. Hawley and Mr. Luján also added new communities, enticing more senators to support the bill now that it would benefit their states. When the measure   on the Senate floor last month — made possible after   between Mr. Hawley and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader — it passed 69 to 30. St. Louis’s radioactive fate was decided over lunch at the elite Noonday Club in the city’s downtown in 1942, when Arthur Compton, a top administrator of the Manhattan Project and the former head of physics at Washington University met with  , a scientist who ran his family’s chemical and pharmaceutical company. Three other companies had already refused Mr. Compton’s request — to begin refining uranium for the development of the bomb. Mr. Mallinckrodt, a longtime friend of Mr. Compton, said yes. Eight decades later, the consequences of that decision are immediately visible on a drive through St. Louis. Cleanup of the creek   until 2038, according to The Missouri Independent. At the site of the old airport, where the first radioactive waste from the plant was stored, workers clad in white Tyvek hazardous materials suits with bright yellow boots can be seen from the highway, digging into the ground behind fences adorned with yellow warning signs and next to rail cars loaded with contaminated soil. Some miles down is  , a pit holding   that originated at Mallinckrodt and was illegally dumped in an area now surrounded by chain restaurants, warehouses, and a hospital. By 2010, a growing underground fire about   was discovered. Around the same time, Kim Visintine, an engineer-turned-medical professional, began to realize in conversations with friends that the rate at which their families and classmates were falling ill with serious, rare cancers “was just historically way beyond the norm,” she said. Ms. Visintine’s son, Zach, was born with   — the most aggressive type of brain tumor — and died at age 6. She started a Facebook page called “ ” and began mapping reports of serious illnesses linked to radiation, coloring in heavily affected neighborhoods in shades of red. There were soon thousands of examples. “It just looked like it was bleeding through,” Ms. Visintine said of the red on the maps. The illnesses have stretched across the city, and reached deep into family trees. Carl Chappell’s father, a chemical operator, used to walk to work at the plant in the early 1950s, until he began working at the company’s  , where scientists researched and produced high-enriched nuclear fuel. It was there, in 1956, that his father was exposed to a radiation spill. “We didn’t know that that was radioactive,” Mr. Chappell recalled in an interview. “All we knew was he was exposed to some toxic chemical spill and hospitalized for a few days or several days down there until he was released to come home.” Eight years later, his father was diagnosed with renal cancer. Within another eight years, he had died. He was 48. Decades later, at the age of 40, Mr. Chappell’s son Stephen was diagnosed with a rare kind of mucinous cancer that began in his appendix and spread throughout his abdomen. He died at 44. For some families, developing cancer feels inevitable. Kay Hake’s father, Marvin, was an engineer at the Mallinckrodt plant and survived bladder, prostate and skin cancer. Her husband, John, who worked as a heavy equipment operator, was among a team of workers dispatched years ago to help clean up toxic waste from  . Sometimes he was given protective equipment to wear, but other times he was not. “Every time we get sick, we think it’s probably cancer,” Mr. Hake said in a recent interview over coffee. “Sometimes we’re planning for the future and it’s like, ‘Let’s not plan too far and try to enjoy our lives more.’ Because we don’t know if we’re going to make it.” “It’s not if it’s going to happen,” Ms. Hake added. “It’s when.” Christen Commuso, who grew up near the creek and has lobbied extensively for the expansion of the program through her work for the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, has found a small comfort in hoping that the suffering in her family will stop with her. After Ms. Commuso developed thyroid cancer, doctors removed her thyroid, adrenal gland, gallbladder and eventually her uterus and ovaries. At first, Ms. Commuso said in an interview, she “really mourned the loss of my ability to have my own children.” “But at the same time, there’s a part of me that feels like well, maybe it was a blessing in disguise,” she added. “Because I didn’t pass something down to a new generation.” She was in the Senate chamber in March when lawmakers approved the legislation to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to cover Missourians like her. Just the provision in the existing law to fund screening clinics for survivors would help, she said, because she sometimes skips doctor’s appointments when she cannot afford them. “I wanted to clap and scream and holler” when it passed, Ms. Commuso said. But she also found it jarring to see how nonchalant senators were as they voted on her fate — with a customary thumbs up or thumbs down to the Senate clerk. “To watch people kind of give a thumbs up or a thumbs down on your life — and does your life matter to them? It’s like, what do you have to say and do to convince people that you matter?” An earlier version of this article misstated the month in which the Senate passed legislation to expand a federal law compensating victims of nuclear waste radiation. The bill was passed last month, not this month. How we handle corrections  covers Congress for The Times.

Sometimes he was given protective equipment to wear, but other times he was not. “Every time we get sick, we think it’s probably cancer,” Mr. Hake said in a recent interview over coffee. “Sometimes we’re planning for the future and it’s like, ‘Let’s not plan too far and try to enjoy our lives more.’ Because we don’t know if we’re going to make it.” “It’s not if it’s going to happen,” Ms. Hake added. “It’s when.” Christen Commuso, who grew up near the creek and has lobbied extensively for the expansion of the program through her work for the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, has found a small comfort in hoping that the suffering in her family will stop with her. After Ms. Commuso developed thyroid cancer, doctors removed her thyroid, adrenal gland, gallbladder and eventually her uterus and ovaries. At first, Ms. Commuso said in an interview, she “really mourned the loss of my ability to have my own children.” “But at the same time, there’s a part of me that feels like well, maybe it was a blessing in disguise,” she added. “Because I didn’t pass something down to a new generation.” She was in the Senate chamber in March when lawmakers approved the legislation to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to cover Missourians like her. Just the provision in the existing law to fund screening clinics for survivors would help, she said, because she sometimes skips doctor’s appointments when she cannot afford them. “I wanted to clap and scream and holler” when it passed, Ms. Commuso said. But she also found it jarring to see how nonchalant senators were as they voted on her fate — with a customary thumbs up or thumbs down to the Senate clerk. “To watch people kind of give a thumbs up or a thumbs down on your life — and does your life matter to them? It’s like, what do you have to say and do to convince people that you matter?” An earlier version of this article misstated the month in which the Senate passed legislation to expand a federal law compensating victims of nuclear waste radiation. The bill was passed last month, not this month. How we handle corrections  covers Congress for The Times.

How Those Colorful Azulejo Tiles Are Made,"A tradition dating back centuries survives in Portugal as artists and companies fill private and public commissions for the celebrated designs. Supported by Reporting from Lisbon There are some crafts that Portugal is especially known for: pavements and plazas patterned with black and white stones, and azulejos, often referred to as tiles, that cover buildings, often in seas of blue and white. Such artistry is being honored this year during the Journées Européennes des Métiers d’Art, or  , from today through April 7, with programs that give an inside look at how the work is done. Portugal’s artisanal heritage will be celebrated on April 7 when ateliers around the country devoted to woodwork, weaving, jewelry, bookbinding and painting tiles will open their doors to the public. Be careful, though, if speaking with Alexandre Pais, director of the   in Lisbon. “Azulejos are not tiles,” he said emphatically, walking through the halls of the palace turned convent turned museum that now houses a collection of some 17,000 azulejos displayed chronologically as visitors move from room to room. “Azulejos have been around more than 500 years,” Dr. Pais said. “They are always changing, always adapting.” To prove his point he singled out a blue and white mural on the wall of Mickey Mouse “from Walt Disney’s office in Lisbon.” Whether it’s the subject matter, the colors or the materials used, azulejos keep pace with the times. Azulejos first came to Portugal from Spain and Arab countries, and the name “is an Islamic word, meaning ‘a polished stone,’” Dr. Pais explained. “The Spanish liked patterns,” he said, standing in front of a display of azulejos from the 16th century, patterned like an image seen inside a kaleidoscope. The Portuguese, however, “were not so interested in patterns,” Dr. Pais said, and instead tended toward creating scenes with what he called “architectural designs,” like a trompe l’oeil panel resembling a door. The azulejos were painted in many colors based in metal oxide — green from copper, purple from manganese, white from tin, brown or orange from iron; the paints were toxic and eventually banned from use in the 1980s, Dr. Pais said. The ancient colors would not be revealed until after the azulejos came out of the kiln. Until then, “the colors all looked gray,” Dr. Pais said, and the painter had to rely on experience to know what colors to work with and how to apply them in various thicknesses to get the desired result. Trade, the economy, politics — azulejo makers responded to the sweep of Portuguese history. Blue and white, the popular color combination from the 17th century to today, was influenced by the Delft tiles being made in the Netherlands, he said, which were inspired by the porcelains being brought back from China by traders from the Dutch East India company. Yellow also began to be used during this period, to suggest gold. The last room of the museum displays what Dr. Pais called “the jewel in the crown,” a 75-foot-long mural of Lisbon as it looked before an earthquake in 1755. By that time, azulejos had become works of art, created by artists, not simply painters. “It was the master period,” Dr. Pais said. And it is one that continues today, witnessed by the contemporary painted azulejos adorning the walls of the former convent’s cloister. In support of the craft, present-day artists have until April 22 to submit a proposal for a paid residency to  , a factory in an industrial park on the outskirts of Sintra, a popular tourist destination less than 20 miles northwest of Lisbon. The program was planned to celebrate the company’s 175th anniversary. (Known originally as the workshop of the founder, António Costa Lamego, it was renamed in 1876 after he died and Margarida Rosa, his widow, or viúva, took over.) At Viúva Lamego, the word “tiles” is freely used, according to Catarina Morais Cardoso, director of marketing. Making them, she said, starts with clay: “We own our own clay quarry.” It arrives premixed as slabs, which are rolled out into sheets of varying thicknesses, depending on their intended use, by a machine resembling a large pasta maker. The sheets of clay are then chopped into squares and prepared for firing in a kiln, painting by hand, firing again, cooling and a final quality check. This all happens in a space the size of an airplane hangar, filled with racks stacked with thousands of tiles in various stages of production and hauled from machine to machine by forklifts. The factory has the capacity to produce 25,000 tiles a day. Viúva Lamego works on commercial projects like hotels and shops and on private commissions, which have included a swimming pool in Edinburgh and a 12-meter-high (almost 40 feet) representation of a wedding cake for Waddesdon Manor, a country estate in Buckinghamshire, England. Clients can choose from a “candy shop” of designs and colors, Ms. Cardoso said, or have something custom-made. “We have an inventory of 72 colors, and our chemical engineer can create new ones,” Ms. Cardoso said, mentioning a customer who wanted tiles in the Majorelle Blue found at Yves Saint Laurent’s home in Marrakesh, Morocco. Viúva Lamego has also provided tiles for public art commissions. “We are in 31 countries,” Ms. Cardoso said. “Ninety percent of the subway stations in Lisbon have our tiles,” as do subways in Moscow and Paris, she said. For large murals, the tiles are marked on the back with a letter (identifying a vertical row) and a number (for a horizontal row) then placed on a numbered and lettered grid on the floor “like a puzzle,” Ms. Cardoso said. The same system of labeling is used in the restoration studio at Manuel Marques Antunes, a family-run business founded in 1985 outside Estoril, a seaside resort 15 miles west of Lisbon. Today the studio is run by Mr. Antunes’s grandchildren — Tiago, Joana and Rita Antunes Rego, who are all in their 30s. “And my mother and father give advice,” Tiago Antunes Rego said. The parental counsel is never far away — the white stucco family home with its terra-cotta roof overlooks the atelier and its yard. The yard is a marvel, an open-air warehouse of azulejos made on site or collected over the years. Thousands of azulejos are stacked like library books on shelves, or placed in plastic bins that used to hold Dannon yogurt at the supermarket. The azulejos are for sale to anyone who wants to visit and poke around. Or customers can go inside the atelier and browse a display of current azulejos in stock, enter another room to place a custom order, or peruse another featuring antique examples. “I can easily tell when the tiles were made by their thickness,” Mr. Rego said, illustrating his point by lifting up some azulejos to show how they became thinner over time, from around 2.5 centimeters (just under an inch) in the 16th century, 1.2 centimeters in the 17th, 1 centimeter in the 18th and even thinner today. No commission, restoration or custom order is too small, Mr. Rego said. “We will reproduce four tiles or 4,000” at a cost of about 20 euros, or $22, per tile, he said. The company also restores azulejos, Mr. Rego said, like those in the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon from the 1960s and ones in the Lisbon home of the French fashion designer Christian Louboutin. An artist, Sónia Guerrinha, is restoring a panel from an old palace in Sintra that is being turned into a hotel. There are portions of individual tiles missing, as well as entire sections of blank spaces where the azulejos had fallen off because, Mr. Rego said, “it’s humid in Sintra.” That natural calamity provides Ms. Marques with the most exciting part of her job. “I have to imagine what it looked like,” she said in the restoration studio. After researching in the company’s library and studying what remains of the panel, it’s her call. “I will provide a sketch of the design,” she said, and when it is approved she will complete the many steps that turn it into a finished azulejo. For antique tiles, recreating the background color is key, and the formula is guarded. “We have our secret recipe, like Coca-Cola,” Mr. Rego said. Azulejos are such a part of Portugal’s identity that representations of them can be found on the sides of tuk-tuks lining Lisbon’s majestic waterfront square the Praça do Comércio and on tubes of toothpaste on pharmacy shelves. “Azulejos represent a genuinely unique expression of Portuguese culture,” Dr. Pais said. “They are not just tiles.”  After a time of relative stability,   because of broader political and economic forces. Or is it simply a generational passing of the torch?  Fourteen years and one Apple App of the Year award in,  : a tool that works for both experts and newbies.  The 59-year-old actor, who revels in doing “weird things all the time,”   about aging to New York. The   about life in Miami and her new cookbook, “Nourish.”  For a younger generation, the   packs about as much of a punch as a smiley face.  A recurring cast of milliners and costumed spectators trading nods with the more casual participants — who found creative ways to   — was a particular delight to see.

Making them, she said, starts with clay: “We own our own clay quarry.” It arrives premixed as slabs, which are rolled out into sheets of varying thicknesses, depending on their intended use, by a machine resembling a large pasta maker. The sheets of clay are then chopped into squares and prepared for firing in a kiln, painting by hand, firing again, cooling and a final quality check. This all happens in a space the size of an airplane hangar, filled with racks stacked with thousands of tiles in various stages of production and hauled from machine to machine by forklifts. The factory has the capacity to produce 25,000 tiles a day. Viúva Lamego works on commercial projects like hotels and shops and on private commissions, which have included a swimming pool in Edinburgh and a 12-meter-high (almost 40 feet) representation of a wedding cake for Waddesdon Manor, a country estate in Buckinghamshire, England. Clients can choose from a “candy shop” of designs and colors, Ms. Cardoso said, or have something custom-made. “We have an inventory of 72 colors, and our chemical engineer can create new ones,” Ms. Cardoso said, mentioning a customer who wanted tiles in the Majorelle Blue found at Yves Saint Laurent’s home in Marrakesh, Morocco. Viúva Lamego has also provided tiles for public art commissions. “We are in 31 countries,” Ms. Cardoso said. “Ninety percent of the subway stations in Lisbon have our tiles,” as do subways in Moscow and Paris, she said. For large murals, the tiles are marked on the back with a letter (identifying a vertical row) and a number (for a horizontal row) then placed on a numbered and lettered grid on the floor “like a puzzle,” Ms. Cardoso said. The same system of labeling is used in the restoration studio at Manuel Marques Antunes, a family-run business founded in 1985 outside Estoril, a seaside resort 15 miles west of Lisbon. Today the studio is run by Mr. Antunes’s grandchildren — Tiago, Joana and Rita Antunes Rego, who are all in their 30s. “And my mother and father give advice,” Tiago Antunes Rego said. The parental counsel is never far away — the white stucco family home with its terra-cotta roof overlooks the atelier and its yard. The yard is a marvel, an open-air warehouse of azulejos made on site or collected over the years. Thousands of azulejos are stacked like library books on shelves, or placed in plastic bins that used to hold Dannon yogurt at the supermarket. The azulejos are for sale to anyone who wants to visit and poke around. Or customers can go inside the atelier and browse a display of current azulejos in stock, enter another room to place a custom order, or peruse another featuring antique examples. “I can easily tell when the tiles were made by their thickness,” Mr. Rego said, illustrating his point by lifting up some azulejos to show how they became thinner over time, from around 2.5 centimeters (just under an inch) in the 16th century, 1.2 centimeters in the 17th, 1 centimeter in the 18th and even thinner today. No commission, restoration or custom order is too small, Mr. Rego said. “We will reproduce four tiles or 4,000” at a cost of about 20 euros, or $22, per tile, he said. The company also restores azulejos, Mr. Rego said, like those in the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon from the 1960s and ones in the Lisbon home of the French fashion designer Christian Louboutin. An artist, Sónia Guerrinha, is restoring a panel from an old palace in Sintra that is being turned into a hotel. There are portions of individual tiles missing, as well as entire sections of blank spaces where the azulejos had fallen off because, Mr. Rego said, “it’s humid in Sintra.” That natural calamity provides Ms. Marques with the most exciting part of her job. “I have to imagine what it looked like,” she said in the restoration studio. After researching in the company’s library and studying what remains of the panel, it’s her call. “I will provide a sketch of the design,” she said, and when it is approved she will complete the many steps that turn it into a finished azulejo. For antique tiles, recreating the background color is key, and the formula is guarded. “We have our secret recipe, like Coca-Cola,” Mr. Rego said. Azulejos are such a part of Portugal’s identity that representations of them can be found on the sides of tuk-tuks lining Lisbon’s majestic waterfront square the Praça do Comércio and on tubes of toothpaste on pharmacy shelves. “Azulejos represent a genuinely unique expression of Portuguese culture,” Dr. Pais said. “They are not just tiles.”  After a time of relative stability,   because of broader political and economic forces. Or is it simply a generational passing of the torch?  Fourteen years and one Apple App of the Year award in,  : a tool that works for both experts and newbies.  The 59-year-old actor, who revels in doing “weird things all the time,”   about aging to New York. The   about life in Miami and her new cookbook, “Nourish.”  For a younger generation, the   packs about as much of a punch as a smiley face.  A recurring cast of milliners and costumed spectators trading nods with the more casual participants — who found creative ways to   — was a particular delight to see.

New York City Set to Pay a Record $28 Million to Settle Rikers Island Suit,"Advertisement Supported by Eight correction officers and a captain stood by for seven minutes and 51 seconds as Nicholas Feliciano tried to hang himself in a jail cell in 2019.  and  New York City has agreed to pay more than $28 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of Nicholas Feliciano, who suffered severe brain damage after he attempted to hang himself in a Rikers Island jail cell as more than half a dozen correction officers stood by. If approved by a judge, it will be among the largest pretrial settlements ever to be awarded to a single plaintiff in a civil rights case in New York City. Mr. Feliciano was 18 and had a long history of psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide attempts when he was sent to Rikers in late 2019 on a parole violation. When he tried to hang himself on Nov. 27 of that year, guards watched as he flailed his arms but did not intervene even after he became limp, video footage obtained by The New York Times shows. The Bronx district attorney filed felony charges against three of the guards and a captain in 2022. Last year, two of the guards pleaded guilty to official misconduct, a misdemeanor, and avoided jail time. The cases against the captain and the remaining officer are pending. For the past four years, Mr. Feliciano has received round-the-clock care, first at the Bellevue Hospital Center and then at a rehabilitation facility where he must use a walker to get around, said his grandmother, Madeline Feliciano, 57. He cannot eat without assistance, has short-term memory loss and struggles to remember visits with family and friends or the things he did the day before, she said. The proposed settlement, Ms. Feliciano said, will help his family care for him at home. A final decision in the case could come as early as next week. “It is not going to bring Nicholas back to who he was,” she said, adding that, at 22, “he has to live with this injury for rest of his life.”  A Correction Department spokeswoman said the agency has taken steps to reduce self-harm among detainees through renovations to housing areas, including the installation of fencing around units with multiple floors. She said officers are trained to prevent suicides and recognize signs of distress among mentally ill detainees and that specialists are assigned to people who have a history of trying to harm themselves. But the New York City Board of Correction, a jails oversight panel,  that many of the problems that had given rise to Mr. Feliciano’s case have only worsened. Over the past three years, at least 18 mentally ill detainees have killed themselves or died of drug overdoses or other causes, records and interviews show. And the number of detainees with psychiatric needs has risen: About one in five people held on Rikers has some form of  . The New York Times obtained Department of Correction jail surveillance and body-worn camera footage that was gathered by a law firm, Beldock, Levine & Hoffman, which represented Mr. Feliciano and his family in their lawsuits against the city. Depicting the events leading up to Mr. Feliciano’s suicide attempt in a holding pen, and the inaction of correction staff members, the videos offer a rare look at what can befall  , where they are often subject to harsh conditions, inhumane treatment and inadequate supervision. Mr. Feliciano’s lawyer, David B. Rankin, said the Department of Correction failed his client the moment he entered Rikers. Mr. Feliciano, who was diagnosed with clinical depression, was placed in a general population housing area known for gang violence instead of in a mental health unit. He was not initially given the antipsychotic medication he had been taking while at home. Mr. Feliciano’s case, Mr. Rankin said, “shows how the city has no ability to run a jail.” Mr. Feliciano’s mental health needs had been recorded in meticulous detail, including during his first stint on Rikers in 2018, when at 16, he spent weeks on suicide watch and told staff about his bouts of depression. They were further documented when he received treatment on mental health units, and recorded again when he landed in a city-run juvenile center, where he had to be hospitalized several times for harming himself. He once cut himself, and using his blood, wrote “ ” across the housing area plexiglass, according to a report by the Board of Correction. Despite this history of psychiatric problems, Mr. Feliciano was rated as being at zero risk of suicide when he landed on Rikers in November 2019. On Nov. 27, at about 5:30 p.m., Mr. Feliciano was attacked by several detainees. It was his second violent encounter in two days, occurring as he tried to help a friend who was being assaulted by several people. Video shows Mr. Feliciano bleeding from the left side of his body and mouth. Officers isolated him in a holding pen for hours as he awaited transportation to an urgent care clinic. Mr. Feliciano first appeared to begin searching the ceiling for a weight-bearing object at 11:26 p.m., according to still images of video footage. Over the next five minutes, he fashions his clothing into a makeshift noose. One officer, Kenneth Hood II, stands directly in front of Mr. Feliciano’s cell for a full minute, watching as Mr. Feliciano ties his clothing to a U-shape hook in the ceiling, tests his weight against it and briefly wraps it around his neck. Then he unties himself, picks up a nearby plate of food and sits on a metal bench. Alone and shirtless in the cell, Mr. Feliciano appears to tap the fork nervously against the plate. He grows agitated while speaking to a captain and two correction officers, including Mr. Hood, and he jumps up to throw the plate at them. The guards rush from the area. The captain, Terry Henry, walks back past Mr. Feliciano, seeming to laugh and gesture toward him. Mr. Feliciano walks to the sweater he had attached to a ceiling fixture above the toilet. (It was the same ceiling hook that had been used in a suicide attempt by another mentally ill man,  , six days earlier, and it was supposed to have been removed by the time Mr. Feliciano was put in the cell, two people with knowledge of the incident said.) Having already tied one sweatshirt to the ceiling, he climbs atop a partition to attach a second sweatshirt to the cell bars, video shows. What happened next was documented in a 2019   of the incident, but the newly obtained videos offer a firsthand look at the inaction of nine jailers who stood by, walked past or glanced over at Mr. Feliciano’s cell for seven minutes and 51 seconds as he flailed at the end of the sweatshirts. After climbing atop the privacy partition at 11:41 p.m., Mr. Feliciano wraps the sweatshirts around his neck and jumps down, video shows. Within seconds, he struggles to pull himself up, but the tips of his toes barely touch the floor. Officer Daniel Fullerton, completing paperwork near a booth, occasionally looks over at cell 11 where Mr. Feliciano is hanging, but he does not intervene, video shows. Officer Mark Wilson walks to the cell, opens the door, looks at Mr. Feliciano for a moment and then closes the door and walks away, video shows. At 11:43 p.m., officer Jean Lantigua-Peña, papers in hand, looks over at the cell, and officer Nicholas Prensa walks into and out of the area. Neither officer moves to help Mr. Feliciano. A minute later, two paramedics pushing a man on a gurney enter the frame along with two other correction officers. Over the next three minutes the paramedics, Jimmy Guailacela and Stephen Sham, and correction officers, Sincere Crowell and Peter Moses, look in Mr. Feliciano’s direction several times, but do not come to his aid, the video shows. (Mr. Guailacela was promoted to lieutenant in 2021.) The man on the gurney, Alfonso Martinez, was a friend of Mr. Feliciano’s, and he said in a previous interview with The Times that he shouted for someone to help but was ignored. Six minutes after Mr. Feliciano jumped, Officer Hood and Officer Kostantinos Makridis walk past the cell toward a nearby door. Officer Makridis slows down, stops and leans in toward the cell bars to get a closer look at Mr. Feliciano’s motionless body. Three guards enter Mr. Feliciano’s cell. Officer Henry cuffs one of his wrists, while Officer Fullerton untwists Mr. Feliciano from the sweatshirts at 11:49 p.m. They fall back as Mr. Feliciano crumples to the floor. Officer Makridis attempts chest compressions, but he places his hands in the wrong place, on Mr. Feliciano’s abdomen, until Captain Henry corrects him. Officer Makridis continues the compressions for about two minutes, frequently stopping then starting again, as Captain Henry and Officer Fullerton appear to fumble with a defibrillator. Around this time, jail medical staff enter the cell and take over. At 12:45 a.m., more than an hour after Mr. Feliciano had tried to hang himself, paramedics place him on a stretcher to take him to a nearby hospital. The Department of Correction’s investigations division later found that all nine of the guards who did not intervene had failed to do their job, records show. Six — Officers Hood, Makridis, Prensa, Fullerton and Wilson and Captain Henry — were suspended without pay for 30 days. The Bronx district attorney charged four of the guards in 2022. Two of them, Mr. Fullerton and Mr. Wilson pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges. Mr. Fullerton resigned and Mr. Wilson was fired. The other two, Captain Henry and Officer Hood, are still awaiting trial. After the guards were indicted, the correction officers’ union said that the case against them was “being driven more by politics than by facts.” Mr. Lantigua-Peña resigned in May 2020. Officers Moses and Crowell were charged with “procedural violations” by the department but were not suspended or put on modified duty and are still working in the jails. Before they ever encountered Mr. Feliciano, seven of the guards had faced disciplinary charges and complaints from supervisors for offenses ranging from lying on official records and failing to supervise detainees to using excessive force and walking off the job. Captain Henry, the supervisor who did not intervene as Mr. Feliciano was hanging, had been disciplined in a similar case in 2015, when, as a correction officer, he failed to help a man convulsing on the floor, according to a lawsuit. The man died, and the city settled the lawsuit for $1.59 million. Captain Henry, who still works in the jails, has had at least 14 complaints or disciplinary charges over the years. Half of those complaints were logged in the years after Mr. Feliciano was on Rikers, jail records show.  is an investigative reporter on the Metro desk focusing on criminal justice issues, law enforcement and incarceration in New York.

Depicting the events leading up to Mr. Feliciano’s suicide attempt in a holding pen, and the inaction of correction staff members, the videos offer a rare look at what can befall  , where they are often subject to harsh conditions, inhumane treatment and inadequate supervision. Mr. Feliciano’s lawyer, David B. Rankin, said the Department of Correction failed his client the moment he entered Rikers. Mr. Feliciano, who was diagnosed with clinical depression, was placed in a general population housing area known for gang violence instead of in a mental health unit. He was not initially given the antipsychotic medication he had been taking while at home. Mr. Feliciano’s case, Mr. Rankin said, “shows how the city has no ability to run a jail.” Mr. Feliciano’s mental health needs had been recorded in meticulous detail, including during his first stint on Rikers in 2018, when at 16, he spent weeks on suicide watch and told staff about his bouts of depression. They were further documented when he received treatment on mental health units, and recorded again when he landed in a city-run juvenile center, where he had to be hospitalized several times for harming himself. He once cut himself, and using his blood, wrote “ ” across the housing area plexiglass, according to a report by the Board of Correction. Despite this history of psychiatric problems, Mr. Feliciano was rated as being at zero risk of suicide when he landed on Rikers in November 2019. On Nov. 27, at about 5:30 p.m., Mr. Feliciano was attacked by several detainees. It was his second violent encounter in two days, occurring as he tried to help a friend who was being assaulted by several people. Video shows Mr. Feliciano bleeding from the left side of his body and mouth. Officers isolated him in a holding pen for hours as he awaited transportation to an urgent care clinic. Mr. Feliciano first appeared to begin searching the ceiling for a weight-bearing object at 11:26 p.m., according to still images of video footage. Over the next five minutes, he fashions his clothing into a makeshift noose. One officer, Kenneth Hood II, stands directly in front of Mr. Feliciano’s cell for a full minute, watching as Mr. Feliciano ties his clothing to a U-shape hook in the ceiling, tests his weight against it and briefly wraps it around his neck. Then he unties himself, picks up a nearby plate of food and sits on a metal bench. Alone and shirtless in the cell, Mr. Feliciano appears to tap the fork nervously against the plate. He grows agitated while speaking to a captain and two correction officers, including Mr. Hood, and he jumps up to throw the plate at them. The guards rush from the area. The captain, Terry Henry, walks back past Mr. Feliciano, seeming to laugh and gesture toward him. Mr. Feliciano walks to the sweater he had attached to a ceiling fixture above the toilet. (It was the same ceiling hook that had been used in a suicide attempt by another mentally ill man,  , six days earlier, and it was supposed to have been removed by the time Mr. Feliciano was put in the cell, two people with knowledge of the incident said.) Having already tied one sweatshirt to the ceiling, he climbs atop a partition to attach a second sweatshirt to the cell bars, video shows. What happened next was documented in a 2019   of the incident, but the newly obtained videos offer a firsthand look at the inaction of nine jailers who stood by, walked past or glanced over at Mr. Feliciano’s cell for seven minutes and 51 seconds as he flailed at the end of the sweatshirts. After climbing atop the privacy partition at 11:41 p.m., Mr. Feliciano wraps the sweatshirts around his neck and jumps down, video shows. Within seconds, he struggles to pull himself up, but the tips of his toes barely touch the floor. Officer Daniel Fullerton, completing paperwork near a booth, occasionally looks over at cell 11 where Mr. Feliciano is hanging, but he does not intervene, video shows. Officer Mark Wilson walks to the cell, opens the door, looks at Mr. Feliciano for a moment and then closes the door and walks away, video shows. At 11:43 p.m., officer Jean Lantigua-Peña, papers in hand, looks over at the cell, and officer Nicholas Prensa walks into and out of the area. Neither officer moves to help Mr. Feliciano. A minute later, two paramedics pushing a man on a gurney enter the frame along with two other correction officers. Over the next three minutes the paramedics, Jimmy Guailacela and Stephen Sham, and correction officers, Sincere Crowell and Peter Moses, look in Mr. Feliciano’s direction several times, but do not come to his aid, the video shows. (Mr. Guailacela was promoted to lieutenant in 2021.) The man on the gurney, Alfonso Martinez, was a friend of Mr. Feliciano’s, and he said in a previous interview with The Times that he shouted for someone to help but was ignored. Six minutes after Mr. Feliciano jumped, Officer Hood and Officer Kostantinos Makridis walk past the cell toward a nearby door. Officer Makridis slows down, stops and leans in toward the cell bars to get a closer look at Mr. Feliciano’s motionless body. Three guards enter Mr. Feliciano’s cell. Officer Henry cuffs one of his wrists, while Officer Fullerton untwists Mr. Feliciano from the sweatshirts at 11:49 p.m. They fall back as Mr. Feliciano crumples to the floor. Officer Makridis attempts chest compressions, but he places his hands in the wrong place, on Mr. Feliciano’s abdomen, until Captain Henry corrects him. Officer Makridis continues the compressions for about two minutes, frequently stopping then starting again, as Captain Henry and Officer Fullerton appear to fumble with a defibrillator. Around this time, jail medical staff enter the cell and take over. At 12:45 a.m., more than an hour after Mr. Feliciano had tried to hang himself, paramedics place him on a stretcher to take him to a nearby hospital. The Department of Correction’s investigations division later found that all nine of the guards who did not intervene had failed to do their job, records show. Six — Officers Hood, Makridis, Prensa, Fullerton and Wilson and Captain Henry — were suspended without pay for 30 days. The Bronx district attorney charged four of the guards in 2022. Two of them, Mr. Fullerton and Mr. Wilson pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges. Mr. Fullerton resigned and Mr. Wilson was fired. The other two, Captain Henry and Officer Hood, are still awaiting trial. After the guards were indicted, the correction officers’ union said that the case against them was “being driven more by politics than by facts.” Mr. Lantigua-Peña resigned in May 2020. Officers Moses and Crowell were charged with “procedural violations” by the department but were not suspended or put on modified duty and are still working in the jails. Before they ever encountered Mr. Feliciano, seven of the guards had faced disciplinary charges and complaints from supervisors for offenses ranging from lying on official records and failing to supervise detainees to using excessive force and walking off the job. Captain Henry, the supervisor who did not intervene as Mr. Feliciano was hanging, had been disciplined in a similar case in 2015, when, as a correction officer, he failed to help a man convulsing on the floor, according to a lawsuit. The man died, and the city settled the lawsuit for $1.59 million. Captain Henry, who still works in the jails, has had at least 14 complaints or disciplinary charges over the years. Half of those complaints were logged in the years after Mr. Feliciano was on Rikers, jail records show.  is an investigative reporter on the Metro desk focusing on criminal justice issues, law enforcement and incarceration in New York.

From the Horror to the Envy of Africa: Rwanda’s Ruler Holds Tight Grip,"Thirty years after a devastating genocide, Rwanda has made impressive gains. But ethnic divisions persist under an iron-fisted president who has ruled for just as long. Supported by Blood coursed through the streets of Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, in April 1994 as machete-wielding militiamen began a campaign of genocide that killed as many as 800,000 people, one of the great horrors of the late 20th century. Thirty years later, Kigali is the envy of Africa. Smooth streets curl past gleaming towers that hold banks, luxury hotels and tech startups. There is a Volkswagen car plant and an  . A 10,000-seat arena hosts Africa’s biggest basketball league and concerts by stars like Kendrick Lamar, the American rapper, who performed there in December. Tourists fly in to visit Rwanda’s famed gorillas. Government officials from other African countries arrive for lessons in good governance. The electricity is reliable. Traffic cops do not solicit bribes. Violence is rare. The architect of this stunning transformation, President Paul Kagame, achieved it with harsh methods that would normally attract international condemnation. Opponents are jailed, free speech is curtailed and critics often die in murky circumstances, even those living in the West. Mr. Kagame’s soldiers have been accused of massacre and plunder in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. For decades, Western leaders have looked past Mr. Kagame’s abuses. Some have   to halt the genocide, when Hutu extremists massacred people mostly from Mr. Kagame’s Tutsi ethnic group. Rwanda’s tragic history makes it an “ ,” Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, once said. Mr. Kagame will commemorate the 30th anniversary of the genocide on Sunday, when he is expected to lay wreaths at mass graves, light a flame of remembrance and deliver a solemn speech that may well reinforce his message of exceptionalism. “Never again,” he often says. But the anniversary is also a sharp reminder that Mr. Kagame, 66, has been in power for just as long. He won the last presidential election with 99 percent of votes. The outcome of the next one, scheduled for July, is in little doubt. Under Rwanda’s Constitution, he could rule for another decade. The milepost has given new ammunition to critics who say that Mr. Kagame’s repressive tactics, previously seen as necessary — even by critics — to stabilize Rwanda after the genocide, increasingly appear to be a way for him to entrench his iron rule. Questions are also growing about where he is leading his country. Although he claims to have effectively banished ethnicity from Rwanda, critics — including diplomats, former government officials and many other Rwandans — say he presides over a system that is shaped by unspoken ethnic cleavages that make the prospect of genuine reconciliation seem as distant as ever. A spokeswoman for Rwanda’s government did not respond to questions for this article. The authorities declined accreditation to me to enter the country. A second Times reporter has been allowed in. Ethnic Tutsis dominate the top echelons of Mr. Kagame’s government, while the Hutus who make up 85 percent of the population remain excluded from true power, critics say. It is a sign that ethnic division, despite surface appearances, is still very much a factor in the way Rwanda is ruled. “The Kagame regime is creating the very conditions that cause political violence in our country,” Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, his most prominent political opponent, said by phone from Kigali. “Lack of democracy, absence of rule of law, social and political exclusion — it’s the same problems we had before.” Ms. Ingabire, a Hutu, returned to Rwanda from exile in 2010 to run against Mr. Kagame for president. She was arrested, barred from taking part in the election and later imprisoned on charges of conspiracy and terrorism. Released in 2018, when Mr. Kagame pardoned her, Ms. Ingabire cannot travel abroad and is barred from standing in the election in July. “I agree with those who say Rwanda needed a strongman ruler after the genocide, to bring order in our country, ” she said. “But today, after 30 years, we need strong institutions more than we need strong men.” Mr. Kagame burst into power in July 1994, sweeping into Kigali at the head of a Tutsi-dominated rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which ousted the Hutu extremists who orchestrated the genocide. Randy Strash, a worker with the aid agency World Vision, arrived a few weeks later to find a “ghost town.” “No gas stations, no stores, no communications,” he recalled. “Abandoned vehicles by the side of the road, riddled with bullets. At night, the sound of gunshots and hand grenades. It was something else.” Mr. Strash set up his tent across the street from a camp where Mr. Kagame was quartered. Hutu fighters attacked the camp several times, trying to kill Mr. Kagame, Mr. Strash said. But it was not until a decade later, at an event at the University of Washington, that he met the Rwandan leader in person. “Very polite and reasonable in his responses,” Mr. Strash recalled. “Clear, thoughtful and thought-provoking.”  this week show how much U.S. leaders knew about the slaughter as it unfolded. Writing to President Bill Clinton on May 16, 1994, the researcher   “to protect these defenseless civilians from murderous militia.” Since coming to power, Mr. Kagame has had a reputation for spending aid wisely and promoting forward-looking economic policies. Although former aides have accused him of   to exaggerate progress, Rwanda’s trajectory is impressive: Average life expectancy rose to 66 years from 40 years between 1994 and 2021, the United Nations says. One of Mr. Kagame’s first acts was to publicly erase the dangerous divisions that had fueled the genocide. He banned the terms Hutu and Tutsi from identity cards and  . “We are all Rwandan” became the national motto. But in reality, ethnicity continued to suffuse nearly every aspect of life, reinforced by Mr. Kagame’s policies. “Everyone knows who is who,” said Joseph Sebarenzi, a Tutsi who served as the president of Rwanda’s Parliament until 2000, when he fled into exile.  last year by Filip Reyntjens, a Belgian professor and outspoken Kagame critic, found that 82 percent of 199 top government positions were held by ethnic Tutsi — and nearly 100 percent in Mr. Kagame’s office. American diplomats reached a similar conclusion in 2008, after conducting their own survey of Rwanda’s power structure. Mr. Kagame “must begin to share authority with Hutus to a much greater degree” if his country were to surmount the divides of the genocide, the U.S. Embassy   that was later published by WikiLeaks. Critics accuse Mr. Kagame of using the memory of the events of 1994 to suppress the Hutu majority. Official commemorations mention “the genocide of the Tutsi” but play down or ignore the tens of thousands of moderate Hutus who were also killed, often trying to save their Tutsi neighbors. A perception of selective justice rubs salt into those wounds. Mr. Kagame’s troops killed 25,000 to 45,000 people, mostly Hutu civilians, from April to August 1994, according to disputed  . Yet fewer than 40 of his officers have been tried for those crimes, according to Human Rights Watch. The Hutu killings are incomparable in scale or nature to the genocide. But Mr. Kagame’s lopsided approach to dealing with those events is hampering Rwandans’ ability to reconcile and move on, critics say. “Anyone not familiar with Rwanda might think that everything is fine,” Mr. Sebarenzi said. “People work together, they go to church together, they do business together. That is good. But under the carpet, those ethnic divisions are still there.” Although Mr. Kagame has appointed Hutus to senior positions in government since 1994, including prime minister and defense minister, those appointees have little real power, said Omar Khalfan, a former official with Rwanda’s national intelligence service who fled into exile in the United States in 2015.

A Tutsi who lost his parents in the genocide, Mr. Mihigo often sang at genocide commemorations and was said to be close to Mr. Kagame’s wife, Jeannette. But on the 20th anniversary, Mr. Mihigo released a song that in coded lyrics called on Rwandans to show empathy for both Tutsi and Hutu victims — effectively, a call for greater reconciliation. Mr. Kagame was furious. A presidential aide said he “didn’t like my song, and that I should ask him for forgiveness,” Mr. Mihigo  . If the singer refused to comply, he added, “they said I’d be dead.” Mr. Mihigo apologized but was convicted on treason charges and imprisoned.

Advertisement","From the Horror to the Envy of Africa: Rwanda’s Ruler Holds Tight Grip Thirty years after a devastating genocide, Rwanda has made impressive gains. But ethnic divisions persist under an iron-fisted president who has ruled for just as long. Supported by Blood coursed through the streets of Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, in April 1994 as machete-wielding militiamen began a campaign of genocide that killed as many as 800,000 people, one of the great horrors of the late 20th century. Thirty years later, Kigali is the envy of Africa. Smooth streets curl past gleaming towers that hold banks, luxury hotels and tech startups. There is a Volkswagen car plant and an  . A 10,000-seat arena hosts Africa’s biggest basketball league and concerts by stars like Kendrick Lamar, the American rapper, who performed there in December. Tourists fly in to visit Rwanda’s famed gorillas. Government officials from other African countries arrive for lessons in good governance. The electricity is reliable. Traffic cops do not solicit bribes. Violence is rare. The architect of this stunning transformation, President Paul Kagame, achieved it with harsh methods that would normally attract international condemnation. Opponents are jailed, free speech is curtailed and critics often die in murky circumstances, even those living in the West. Mr. Kagame’s soldiers have been accused of massacre and plunder in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. For decades, Western leaders have looked past Mr. Kagame’s abuses. Some have   to halt the genocide, when Hutu extremists massacred people mostly from Mr. Kagame’s Tutsi ethnic group. Rwanda’s tragic history makes it an “ ,” Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, once said. Mr. Kagame will commemorate the 30th anniversary of the genocide on Sunday, when he is expected to lay wreaths at mass graves, light a flame of remembrance and deliver a solemn speech that may well reinforce his message of exceptionalism. “Never again,” he often says. But the anniversary is also a sharp reminder that Mr. Kagame, 66, has been in power for just as long. He won the last presidential election with 99 percent of votes. The outcome of the next one, scheduled for July, is in little doubt. Under Rwanda’s Constitution, he could rule for another decade. The milepost has given new ammunition to critics who say that Mr. Kagame’s repressive tactics, previously seen as necessary — even by critics — to stabilize Rwanda after the genocide, increasingly appear to be a way for him to entrench his iron rule. Questions are also growing about where he is leading his country. Although he claims to have effectively banished ethnicity from Rwanda, critics — including diplomats, former government officials and many other Rwandans — say he presides over a system that is shaped by unspoken ethnic cleavages that make the prospect of genuine reconciliation seem as distant as ever. A spokeswoman for Rwanda’s government did not respond to questions for this article. The authorities declined accreditation to me to enter the country. A second Times reporter has been allowed in. Ethnic Tutsis dominate the top echelons of Mr. Kagame’s government, while the Hutus who make up 85 percent of the population remain excluded from true power, critics say. It is a sign that ethnic division, despite surface appearances, is still very much a factor in the way Rwanda is ruled. “The Kagame regime is creating the very conditions that cause political violence in our country,” Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, his most prominent political opponent, said by phone from Kigali. “Lack of democracy, absence of rule of law, social and political exclusion — it’s the same problems we had before.” Ms. Ingabire, a Hutu, returned to Rwanda from exile in 2010 to run against Mr. Kagame for president. She was arrested, barred from taking part in the election and later imprisoned on charges of conspiracy and terrorism. Released in 2018, when Mr. Kagame pardoned her, Ms. Ingabire cannot travel abroad and is barred from standing in the election in July. “I agree with those who say Rwanda needed a strongman ruler after the genocide, to bring order in our country, ” she said. “But today, after 30 years, we need strong institutions more than we need strong men.” Mr. Kagame burst into power in July 1994, sweeping into Kigali at the head of a Tutsi-dominated rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which ousted the Hutu extremists who orchestrated the genocide. Randy Strash, a worker with the aid agency World Vision, arrived a few weeks later to find a “ghost town.” “No gas stations, no stores, no communications,” he recalled. “Abandoned vehicles by the side of the road, riddled with bullets. At night, the sound of gunshots and hand grenades. It was something else.” Mr. Strash set up his tent across the street from a camp where Mr. Kagame was quartered. Hutu fighters attacked the camp several times, trying to kill Mr. Kagame, Mr. Strash said. But it was not until a decade later, at an event at the University of Washington, that he met the Rwandan leader in person. “Very polite and reasonable in his responses,” Mr. Strash recalled. “Clear, thoughtful and thought-provoking.”  this week show how much U.S. leaders knew about the slaughter as it unfolded. Writing to President Bill Clinton on May 16, 1994, the researcher   “to protect these defenseless civilians from murderous militia.” Since coming to power, Mr. Kagame has had a reputation for spending aid wisely and promoting forward-looking economic policies. Although former aides have accused him of   to exaggerate progress, Rwanda’s trajectory is impressive: Average life expectancy rose to 66 years from 40 years between 1994 and 2021, the United Nations says. One of Mr. Kagame’s first acts was to publicly erase the dangerous divisions that had fueled the genocide. He banned the terms Hutu and Tutsi from identity cards and  . “We are all Rwandan” became the national motto. But in reality, ethnicity continued to suffuse nearly every aspect of life, reinforced by Mr. Kagame’s policies. “Everyone knows who is who,” said Joseph Sebarenzi, a Tutsi who served as the president of Rwanda’s Parliament until 2000, when he fled into exile.  last year by Filip Reyntjens, a Belgian professor and outspoken Kagame critic, found that 82 percent of 199 top government positions were held by ethnic Tutsi — and nearly 100 percent in Mr. Kagame’s office. American diplomats reached a similar conclusion in 2008, after conducting their own survey of Rwanda’s power structure. Mr. Kagame “must begin to share authority with Hutus to a much greater degree” if his country were to surmount the divides of the genocide, the U.S. Embassy   that was later published by WikiLeaks. Critics accuse Mr. Kagame of using the memory of the events of 1994 to suppress the Hutu majority. Official commemorations mention “the genocide of the Tutsi” but play down or ignore the tens of thousands of moderate Hutus who were also killed, often trying to save their Tutsi neighbors. A perception of selective justice rubs salt into those wounds. Mr. Kagame’s troops killed 25,000 to 45,000 people, mostly Hutu civilians, from April to August 1994, according to disputed  . Yet fewer than 40 of his officers have been tried for those crimes, according to Human Rights Watch. The Hutu killings are incomparable in scale or nature to the genocide. But Mr. Kagame’s lopsided approach to dealing with those events is hampering Rwandans’ ability to reconcile and move on, critics say. “Anyone not familiar with Rwanda might think that everything is fine,” Mr. Sebarenzi said. “People work together, they go to church together, they do business together. That is good. But under the carpet, those ethnic divisions are still there.” Although Mr. Kagame has appointed Hutus to senior positions in government since 1994, including prime minister and defense minister, those appointees have little real power, said Omar Khalfan, a former official with Rwanda’s national intelligence service who fled into exile in the United States in 2015. Tutsi loyalists are planted in the offices of senior Hutus to keep an eye on them, said Mr. Khalfan, a Tutsi. “The regime doesn’t want to speak about ethnicity because it raises the issue of power-sharing,” he said. “And they don’t want that.” In the West, Mr. Kagame is a firm favorite at gatherings of the global elite such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he   of Ukraine in January.

One thing I’ve learned about presidential campaigns is that you’ll almost never catch a candidate in New York City, unless, of course, they need to raise some money. [MUSIC PLAYING] And last week, that was the case, when three US presidents, Biden, Obama, and Clinton, all gathered at Radio City Music Hall for what the Biden campaign called, quote, “The most successful political fundraiser in American history.” And we just have to take their word for it, in part, because we weren’t able to get in. But here’s the gist — tickets started at $250 on the low end and $100,000 on the high end, which got you a photo with all three presidents, an entrance to a private reception. There were performances by Queen Latifah, Lizzo, and an appearance from Stephen Colbert. In the end, the campaign says it raised more than $25 million. But this wasn’t just another gathering of the rich and famous. It’s an example of something the Biden campaign has done really well — courting big donors, and just, in general, raising a lot of money. In February alone, the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party raised $53 million, bringing their total cash on hand, as of the beginning of March, to $155 million. That’s more than $50 million ahead of where Donald Trump and the RNC say their current fundraising totals are, which, theoretically, should allow Biden’s campaign to build out a more robust operation than their opponents. But to this point, Biden’s money advantage is yet to solve his political problems, like weak poll numbers against Trump, continued concerns about his advanced age, and the enduring critiques of the administration’s role in the war in Gaza. That cropped up at Radio City when activists disrupted the event several times. So with the general election in its early stages, I wanted to check in on the dollars and cents of 2024, on Biden’s impressive totals, Trump’s financial situation, and all the things money can’t buy. Today, it’s all about the Benjamins. From “The New York Times,” I’m Astead Herndon. This is “The Run-Up.” So I’ve been going to political fundraisers for over two decades. And I will tell you that night was electric. I wanted to talk with someone who did get in to that Radio City event. Indulge me with some snoopy questions, like, did you see anybody cool, or were the biggest celebrities the presidents themselves? Well, without a question, the biggest celebrities were the presidents. This is Robert Wolf. He sat in the orchestra. I have to admit, for me, I went with my wife, and it felt like a great date night. We don’t come to the city all that often. And so it was great to see Queen Latifah before, and Lizzo, and Ben Platt, and people that I wouldn’t necessarily go see perform. And obviously Colbert as the moderator, he’s going to be funny, right? There’s a lot of tongue in cheek there. So for me it was kind of like — it was just a fun night. Wolf is a prolific Democratic fundraiser and Wall Street veteran. Most of my career I was on Wall Street at Salomon Brothers for about a decade. And then I moved to UBS, where I was there 18 years as the former CEO and chairman of the Americas and President and COO of the investment bank globally. Wolf was an early fundraiser for Obama, an informal advisor to his presidential campaign. And like a lot of big donors, he later served in Obama’s administration, including on the Economic Recovery Advisory Board after the 2008 financial crisis. He’s also what’s been called a bundler. I can’t say I love the name, but bundler is you raise money and then you race other people. So let’s just say I am going to an event, and I ask 10 other people to give $10,000 each, and they do. Then Robert Wolf will have not only his $10,000 assigned to him, but also that extra $100,000. And if you raise X amount of money, you get invited to fun things. It’s a way to supercharge your ability to donate as an organizer of other people’s money along with your own. Correct. Got it. And I’m not a bundler today. Now Wolf serves on the Biden campaign’s national finance committee, an elite group of some of its biggest donors. So he’s well known in Democratic circles and is well appreciated for his insights and his wallet. I thought he would be a good person to give me the lay of the land when it comes to big money in politics. How does it work? And what should we expect when it comes to big donors and President Biden? So I had the honor of seeing President Biden where I was able to chat with him in January, at a fundraiser in New York City. For me, I’m not there to ask for anything. I’m there to thank him, to let him know — thank him what he’s doing on gun violence, or thank him what he’s doing with respect to Ukraine. My wife and — How does that — how much money does that take? It was expensive. Can I know how much? I think — I think we wrote a check that night — it was high. I think — I just don’t know what the scale of high is. I mean, listen, you can write checks as low as $1 and $10. I think we wrote a check for $50,000 for that dinner. OK. We’ve spent money on politics over the last 20 years. One other question I have is, just how much have you spent do you think in aggregate, and is there a single thing — is the $50,000 the most you’ve written for a thing? No. What’s the most one check you’ve written? I think it was $100,000. For what campaign? Hillary’s. For Hillary’s? Yeah. And how much do you think you’ve probably given in aggregate? I think you can look at the non-PAC side or non-committee side — I mean, my guess is, in aggregate — I mean, my guess is in excess of a million dollars we’ve given. How did you get into political giving and fundraising period? Well, I appreciate that. Back in the early 2000s, for the most part it was called FIRE, Finance, Insurance and Real Estate. And if you looked at everyone giving, the top people, the top companies were either finance, insurance, or real estate. At that time, I was a senior executive at UBS. Being on Wall Street, being a senior executive, it got you the opportunity to meet a lot of people. So I got involved early, specifically with the Kerry campaign. OK. I was anti-Bush. I was against the war. I had two young boys. And I just felt like, at that time, it’s not the direction I wanted to go. And so I got very active with Kerry. And then it’s the list you can’t get off of. If you can get me off of, let me know how. But it’s the gift that keeps on giving. And then I hosted the first fundraiser for President, then-Senator, Obama in New York in March of ‘07. We raised a ton of money, and I became one of his biggest fundraisers nationally. Again — and I guess, does that just — do you just text your phone and say, hey, I have this politician, I think he’s really interesting? What’s actually the process of translating your interest in somebody to a larger group, and then the money part, too. Yeah, so it was interesting, in 2007, most of the Democratic Party was all in Hillary. I was able to meet Obama. I aligned with a lot. It was like that bro card. We’re both Ivy League guys. We both like sports. His mother died of cancer. My dad was going through cancer. All those things — He was against the war part was big, too, especially — And then against the war. And so what happened was I just invited people — like, hey, you should meet this guy. And they all knew of him from the 2004 convention, with his famous speech, “It’s not red state, blue state. We’re the United States,” so on and so forth. And so what happened was I became that guy. People at law firms wanted to meet him, even if it was just to meet him or get their book signed that he had — “Audacity of Hope”— or take a picture with him. People wanted to get to know this guy. And it was a cheap date back then. It was only like $2,100. And so they’re like — they could meet him and at a fairly accessible price. Exactly. Is it access-driven? When you’re saying people wanted to sign a book, they want to meet him, what is the incentive, if we’re thinking about why people want to give? I mean, politics is an aphrodisiac, right? You’re the most powerful person in the world at that time. Most people did not get the opportunity to meet a president in their life, and here’s a possibility to meet someone that could become the president. I get what you’re saying. You’re saying, particularly when you were getting started, what you were able to connect people with is an ability to meet people they wanted to. And they have the means and access to be able to do it through you. Yeah. I mean, I became kind of that guy. I mean, I guess — again, I’m still thinking broadly before we talk about Biden specifically — what is the brand like for Democrats among Wall Street right now? And how has that shifted maybe over the time in which we’re talking about? Yeah. I think it was always about 40 percent were staunch Democrats, 40 percent were staunch Republicans, because of Reaganomics, which is when I started Wall Street in the ‘80s, and 20 percent would go either way. And that — That’s kind of surprising to me. I think of that as more of a Republican crowd, maybe. It’s not because there’s a lot of other issues important to them. And not everyone votes with their pocketbook. I know that they think — they view us as banksters instead of bankers. But what I would say is that — I would say when it was McCain/Obama, it was clearly — Obama got, I’d say, 100 percent of the 20 percent. When it was Romney/Obama, I would say Romney was the majority of Wall Street. He was kind of a Wall Street guy, knew them all. I think with Clinton and Trump, in my opinion, I think Hillary and Bill just are so well-liked in New York. And my gut tells me there were Republicans that went her way, not for Trump as well. And then on the Biden/Trump, it’s hard to even assess because it was such a crazy period. There was no real campaign. Yeah. I mean, I don’t even know. I was going to ask you about that. And I guess I’m asking about right now, too, is there a sense — I’ve heard you previously talk about the ways that you think the progressive wing of Democrats has become too anti-Wall Street. I’m wondering where you view the Biden Democratic Party on that question. And do you think that the party right now makes it easy for you to pitch them to your fellow Wall Street folks? I mean, honestly, I don’t think we’re front and center. Wall Street’s not who it was and what it was. You can raise money from anywhere in almost any sector there is. I mean, media companies and everyone — tech companies. I don’t have to tell you how many firms now lobby. I guess that’s part of what I’m asking. Has small dollar donations has the ability to raise money from other groups changed it? Yeah, grassroots are — it’s more important to get grassroots money than my couple grand or whatever I give — a little more than that — but what I would say is that, first of all, Wall Street wants to give their economic view. They don’t like necessarily to get in the middle of the riff raff because I think they’re nervous about being the meme or being in a polarizing environment with their employees, right? I think voting is very personal today. And there is no generic Wall Street voter anymore. This idea that the progressives think that Wall Street is voting with their pocketbook I think is BS. They may care about climate more than the progressives care about climate, or they may care about gun reform. Gun reform, for me, is front and center. My wife works at Sandy Hook Promise on gun violence prevention and mental health. And so gun violence, for me, is front and center. So y’all are one issue voters in the — Yeah, I would say there is no one issue voter. It used to be because of Reaganomics, right? Taxes, right, or anti-regulation. That’s changed dramatically. The other thing — and this is going to get to Biden specifically — is we have been talking to so many people about how this election puts them in a kind of pickle, because for the majority of Americans, they talk about wanting other options or just being not happy with having the same options again. When you’re in those circles, how is your community feeling about Biden right now? Which community? [LAUGHS] Yeah, that’s a good question. Because I have two sons in their late 20s and that would be — I would be curious about them. That would be a very different conversation. We could — I would hear that answer. But I’m really specific to — I was thinking specific to fundraisers. Is it easy to raise money for Biden right now? The answer is yes. It’s easy because there’s now a campaign. It’s Trump versus Biden. And President Biden was not candidate Biden. So this whole idea of Democratic bedwetters, or, hey, he’s got to get out, I was totally the other way. In my opinion, that transition to becoming more of the candidate took place at the State of the Union. And that State of the Union, in my opinion, I thought he was fantastic. I think he has a hop in his step. I love that he’s now out and about. I like that Kamala — Vice President Harris — I’m sorry, I’ve known her a long time. No, it’s OK. I think I love that she’s out and about. And now we’re in a campaign. People are more active and engaged. Yeah. It’s interesting you’re — I like that you’re pointing to State of the Union as that hinge point because it did feel like there was — the bedwetting had reached its peak right before then, right? There was — whether it was the age questions from the special counsel, whether it was a polling — The calls I was getting. I want to hear about those. No, insane. I want to hear about — what were people — are you someone who feels the angst when people are angsty? It was insane. I was getting calls, you know, why is he running? Do you think he should run? Hey, he’s running. Let’s not even have that discussion. Let’s talk about he’s running and who he’s going to be competing against. And let’s put all of our inner anxiety into helping him win. But I was fielding calls nonstop because, listen, people were seeing President Trump and Nikki Haley — they were in campaign mode. Yeah. So yes, I was fielding it as that nonstop. Age, specifically, or other stuff? I think other stuff. I think, age — I think there was just — listen, there was a nervousness. Can anyone beat Trump? The answer is yes. And now we’re in a situation where it’s much more mano a mano. And we now have choices to make. And forget about what was. Let’s look at what is. Well, let me ask something different then. Yeah. Why aren’t your sons convinced? My sons are very convinced that they will be voting for President Biden versus President Trump. But we were talking, you and I, about the excitement and the issues. Yeah. Our dinner table issues are about Gaza and humanitarian — there’s a big debate going on in the Gen Z’s generation versus the older generation. There’s a debate going on on climate action versus I’m for I’m glad that we’re energy independent. These debates are becoming talked about more and more often. Because I said to you, this idea that democracy is on the line or these cultural issues are more front and center, they are more front and center. I would have never thought, when I was 27 or 29-and-a-half years old, like my boys — I don’t think about the things they think about today because they weren’t front and center to me. One question I have is, do you see what you do in terms of raising money as helping them get there to close that enthusiasm gap? How do you actually view the role of fundraising versus the work that they have to do to pull this off? Money is critical. Let’s not underestimate that. Yes, both sides will be able to have a lot of money. But getting out the vote, getting data, having the right research, being both on paid media and promoted media, having a bunch of people work with the grassroots, that’s important. To think that politics isn’t local, to think that you can do this national campaign and win, that’s complete BS. People are tuning out — most people cut the cord. So the people that you have to get to, you got to be local. So I’m — this idea that raising $26 million is anything other than fantastic is ridiculous. Interesting, because right now there’s a lot of talk about how Trump can’t raise a lot of money. How much do we think a money advantage matters? How much does a money disadvantage matter? Donald Trump has no problem getting on media, right? He has no problem in that type of space. What do you think the money advantage can do for Biden? What do you hope it can do? So I think there’s a bunch to unpack there. Yes, Donald Trump, in some ways, owns the airwaves. You wake up to him. You go to sleep to him. But those are national airwaves. That’s not where voting gets done. So the answer is, yes, it’s important to localize the campaign. It’s important to tell someone in a certain area how they’re helping your wages, or how they’re helping with climate action, or why it’s important that you’re doing red flag laws in certain states on gun violence. The second part I would say is don’t underestimate President Trump. He’s going to be able to raise his money. I’ve said this the other day. Mar-a-Lago is not some homeless shelter, OK? So it’s not like he doesn’t have billionaires sitting there. The rumors of Trump is broke are overblown. [LAUGHS] I mean, that’s complete BS, right? Because you’re going to have — his tax policy is going to be front and center. And so these billionaires, some do vote one dimensional. They’re going to make sure that he’s got money to run on. Yeah, this is helpful because a lot of what we’re reading now is about the lack of funds. You’re saying you trust that in the end, maybe it’s because of tax policy or just because of people’s investment in Republicans, folks will give to him. I think — listen, I want to be clear here. I think President Biden’s going to outraise him. I think we’re going to outwork him. And I think having money early is important for building offices. I get what you’re saying. But if you’re telling me that we don’t think that there’s going to be money at the RNC or the Republican Party for a presidential election where the Senate is important and the House is important, we’re kidding ourselves. Yeah. When you look about the next six months, is there a thing that worries you the most for the prospect of Biden getting reelected? Listen, I think if it’s President Biden versus former President Trump, I think we’re in a good seat. I don’t think there’s more people voting for President Trump than in the past, and I think it would be less. I am worried about the third party situation because we saw what happened with Secretary Clinton. There was no question the third party impacted Secretary Clinton. And so, yeah, I’m nervous of what a third party can — how it impacts us. And if I asked the most brilliant people or pollsters in the world, they could not give me an answer because they don’t know. We don’t know. So, yeah, I’m a Wall Street guy. I buy and sell things. I don’t live great in this gray area. OK, I just don’t. Do you — and this is kind of the last question — I’m like, Citizens United, super PACs, there was so much talk about the influence of money in politics. What’s your assessment of it? Do you think campaigns are too expensive? Do you think there’s too much money in it? Do you think that maybe money doesn’t matter as much as folks saying and it’s all a little overblown? No, yes, there’s way too much money in it. It’s insane. We’re going to spend billions and billions of dollars on this presidential election. And, yeah, there’s too much money in it. And for some, it’s transactional, being an ambassador, being this. That’s not where I am. But I guess to most people, this is the most important thing that they think about every four years. So it seems like it’s too much money at it, but then again, if you’re saying the most important thing that happens every four years, I don’t know, it doesn’t seem that much versus our annual GDP. Yeah, I hear what you’re saying. Well, thank you. I appreciate your time. Thank you for joining us. Thank you. Much appreciated. After the break, the other side of the money race. After talking to Robert Wolf, I wanted to get a bigger picture of the role of money in this race, especially on the Republican side where Trump has been lagging behind in donations while facing mounting legal bills. There’s also the $175 million bond he just paid, the social media company going public, and those $60 bibles he started selling. Well, thank you for joining us. Sorry. I cough right before we start. No, it’s all good. It’s all good. You’re just allergic to me. So I brought in my colleague, Shane Goldmacher, national political correspondent for “The Times” and the person I usually go to when I have questions about money and politics. I started by asking him what to make of Biden’s big money advantage and Trump’s financial struggles. It’s a big gap. And I think the issue isn’t just the size of the gap right now. It’s the potential size of the gap in the coming months, because, by all accounts, Democrats are expected to raise more money in the coming months than Republicans are. So that’s the gap now, and it’s expected to get even bigger — Oh, wow. Interesting. — throughout the rest of the race. What is the cause of it? I mean, one of them is just a general structural cause, which is the candidate who’s sitting in the White House tends to enter the general election with more money. Why is that? Just because people like giving money to the president? Some of it is people like giving money to the president. But more important is that they have controlled the party apparatus for the three years leading up to the beginning of the general election. And so Joe Biden has been raising money with the Democratic Party for basically a year at this point. And it gives you an advantage because Trump was raising in much tinier increments just to fight through the primary. Just to give you a sense of scale, during the primary, Donald Trump was raising $3,300 increments to win that Republican primary. That’s the most he could raise from an individual person into his campaign account. Joe Biden was going around the country and raising in this big mega committee that he shares with the Democratic Party — $929,000 increments. And so you end up with a lot more money if you can raise in that big of a chunk. You’re able to ask for more. You’re able to ask for more. You have smaller donors that you can then fund by using those bigger contributions to advertise to get more small donors. It sort of builds upon itself. Interesting. Why does it cost so much, and increasingly costs more, for these campaigns? I mean, theoretically, these are two candidates the country knows. These aren’t people who have name recognition problems. Why exactly are campaigns so expensive? I mean, the number one answer is television ads or the digital version of television ads. And, look, you can spend an enormous amount of money on television really, really quickly. Just think about Mike Bloomberg’s campaign when he ran for president, right? He ran for president for only a few months, and he spent basically a billion dollars. He was blanketing the television ads for a period. But it is a reminder of how high up that number can run. If you’re buying as many TV ads as you can, it’s basically an unlimited amount of spending that you can go. And so what is the driver? The driver is television ads, first and foremost, and digital ads that now run on television. A lot of people are streaming. But, yeah, running advertising is the overwhelming cost. Everything else you hear about — our field program, our ground game — it tends to be fractions of the dollars spent on advertising on television. Interesting. So what is driving that big advantage that you’re talking about? Do we know where the money gap is coming from? Does Biden have a specific advantage among small donors, big donors? How would we break down why he has so much more money on hand? I think there’s important to think about in two timeframes. The first is right now. And I think he has more money right now because he’s been tapping those bigger institutional donors. Got it. Those people can give large chunks of money. The big Radio City thing we saw last week. Correct. They had 5,000 people in the room. So there’s a lot of smaller donors. You know what, there were also people raising or giving $100,000, that they were going to get a picture with the presidents, right? The next day, he had a smaller gathering of 175 of his donors in New York City. Those people got personalized briefings from the entire senior campaign team. How much did that cost you? You had to, I think, at least given $47,000 something, right? That is the entry level. The highest tier for his bundlers — $2.5 million. Wow. Now, if you’re raising $2.5 million, you might not be going to a big group briefing. You might be getting the president visiting your house on a fundraiser. But there’s enough people that, at a roughly $50,000 limit, you still have 175 of them coming to New York for that personalized briefing. So your first question, where is his advantage right now, it’s a lot of these major donors. They have been tapped. They’ve built out a whole system. Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff, they’ve been traveling around the country at events and scooping up big checks. In the coming months, though, there’s a wider expectation that Joe Biden’s advantage will be driven by smaller donors online, that online Democratic giving has become almost habitual for liberal donors who are amped up about an election, even about the candidates they may not be excited about. They give tons of money, right? Key Senate races are flooded with money each cycle. And whether the Democrat’s a household name or not, they end up raising a lot of money. And there’s a wide expectation that online, even if Democrats aren’t enthused about Joe Biden, they’re going to be enthused about giving money to stop Donald Trump. OK. Let’s focus now on Donald Trump, someone who famously has a lot of money until he doesn’t. Why is he struggling in fundraising so much, considering he has historically done well with small dollar donors. And it seems like what you’re saying, those donations are slowing down. Why is that? Do we know? Yeah, I mean, let me give you an answer — I want to take one little step back, which is that Trump is facing multiple different financial challenges all at once. It’s hard to keep them straight. It is hard to keep them straight. So number one, you’re talking about is politics. How much money does he have in his campaign account? And some of that is, look, he just got through a nominating contest, and he was raising money and spending money to win the nomination. Now, less than maybe some others have before. Usually, at the end of that, you end up with a little bit less and you have to build up. And he hasn’t had that joint agreement with the Republican Party until just now, basically, to raise those bigger chunks of money. In fact, he’s doing that. Just this coming week he has a big event in Palm Beach that they’ve said they’re going to raise $25, $30 million — I think they put out the number $33 million — from a single dinner, because he’s getting all these people who have not given till now. To do that. They’re going to come, and a couple — each member of the couple gives $800,000. That’s $1.6 million for that couple at that dinner. So this is his answer to Radio City. This is his answer — it’s his coming out party for those mega donors checks. This weekend. It’s just coming this week. So the first financial challenge is political, and he just has less money than Joe Biden does. The second one is his legal bills. And he has been spending — now, we’ve reported more than $100 million since he left the White House on legal bills. And the pot of money he’s been tapping for that mostly has been this money raised in the aftermath of the 2020 election. And that money is almost all gone at this point. Is that a different pot than the money he was spending to win the primary? It is a completely different pot. So what happened is, at the end of 2020, he loses the election. And he says, “Please give to me, dear supporters. This thing was rigged. And there’s no evidence of this yet, but I’m going to fight this in the courts. I’m going to fight it everywhere I can. My Election Defense Fund.” And Republican donors gave more money to Donald Trump in the post-election period of 2020 than almost any period they gave during the actual campaign. That is so wild. They were so — — denying the election result paid off for him. He raised $250 million online between the day after the election in the day that Joe Biden was inaugurated. So he spent some of that money fighting recounts or whatever. But you know what, he pocketed most of that money — not personally pocketed, but he put it in a Political Action Committee. And that huge chunk of funds paid has been paying his lawyers ever since then. And so that money has been spent down slowly, slowly, now quickly and quickly. And the total amount of money left in the account that’s been doing that — Save America — it’s his Political Action Committee — is less than $5 million at this point. So he’s basically tapped out that post-2020 surge of money that he got through people giving out of the election denial space. Correct. And so he’s facing not just a political shortfall versus Joe Biden, but this legal fund that he’s been using to pay his lawyers, that’s also going to be in a shortfall. And by the way, he’s going on a trial soon. The costs don’t go down typically when you go on a criminal trial. Yeah, the legal problems have no signs of slowing in terms of what he has to owe. Correct. So the first one is that political. The second is this legal. And the third one, we have a little bit of resolution right now, but it has been a big one, has been the bond he had to post in order to keep all of his businesses active during his appeal on one of the many cases he’s faced, which is a civil fraud case in New York. And that just went down. From what I understand, “The Times” reported he posted a $175 million bond in his civil fraud case, which means that the New York authorities can’t seize his assets while he’s appealing that larger $450 million judgment against him. Can you just explain what that means in more simple terms? Yeah, that third category is like can he keep his businesses and can they keep running in New York? Because the risk was that if he could not pay that, he would have to sell off the businesses to pay said judgment. Yeah, so he has lost the case. And he’s appealing that ruling. And under New York law, when you lose, you still have to pay, basically, the penalty. And so he’s saying the penalty is so big — it was $454 million — it’s so onerous that I can’t even get a bond to do that. And so that has been reduced. So it’s now $175 million. And he has since lined up money. And so it’s like you’re borrowing in order to appeal. And eventually, look, if he loses at the appellate court level and he loses at the final final court, then he will have to make an actual payment. But for now, he can borrow a bond to stave off making those payments. And does that actual payment have to be $450 or $175? As of now, it’s still the $450. But some of the legal experts say the fact that the bond itself was being reduced is maybe a sign that eventually a final judgment could be shrunk. But we don’t know yet. We previously talked to Maggie Haberman about how Trump’s legal fees were basically consuming the campaign in the way that you really just laid out for us. But one thing I couldn’t understand is, like, what are the possible solutions he has to this? I know we have seen some of the efforts with things like Truth Social, his social media company, and other ways he’s been trying to maneuver. I remember hearing about the RNC having an open question about whether they would do it. What is his best shot to come up with some of these answers? I mean, the number one thing to remember is that he could, of course, pay for his own lawyers with his own money. He’s chosen not to do so so far, right? He has chosen not to use his own personal finances to pay for his attorneys. Oh, you’re right. All these buckets are separate from Donald Trump’s bank account. He could choose to use his bank account to solve the issue that he’s running out of money to pay his lawyers. He’s just running out of other people’s money. It doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have any money. [LAUGHS]: That is an important reminder. Right? He has his own set of money that he has chosen not to use to pay his lawyers in his multiple criminal cases because he had this big pot of money from 2020. So option one is you just pay for them yourself. There’s other more complicated options like you create a special legal defense fund. And what are the rules around that if you’re an active candidate for president? There are other ways he can raise money into the PAC that has been paying the lawyers. And in fact, he’s done a small thing along those lines. There was a little float — well, will the RNC actually pay his legal bills? And they said, no, absolutely not. But then that first mega committee we talked about — you can raise those really big checks — there’s a order of operations of who gets the money. The first always is the candidate. The candidate gets the money first. Typically, second is the party, like the Republican National Committee. But in this case, Trump didn’t actually put the party second. He put his PAC second. And that PAC has been paying his lawyers. So we see Trump coming up with these solutions. At this point, if I were to give $100 to Donald Trump’s campaign, do we know how much of that is going to Save America and the legal fees versus how much is going to the actual job of winning an actual election? Yeah, since early last year, $0.10 of every dollar that’s been given online has gone to that Save America account, which has paid almost exclusively for legal stuff. And so, yeah, all those small donors, it’s 10 percent of what they’ve been giving for the last year, which is not an insignificant amount of money and it’s helped pay for some of those. Look, the intertwining of all these things is real. To differentiate what is the Trump legal issues with what is the Trump political issues is kind of — it’s a fool’s errand, right? One of his lawyers was recently co-hosting a fundraiser for his super PAC, right? So they’re not totally separate. They have been separate in terms of actual cash flow. The campaign has not spent money on his personal lawyers. But the idea that they’re separate things — no, I think it’s very much the Donald Trump 2024 campaign is happening in and around courtrooms. I know this is a really unprecedented situation that we’re in. But are these rules being made up as we go along or like — That is an existential question. Yeah! It is kind of — I’m like — because we’ve never been here, is he just test casting new theories about how you use money in politics? Is it just completely uncharted? It’s a little bit uncharted. It’s also that it’s not just him, right? We’re in basically 20 years of candidates testing new theories of how they want to spend and raise money in politics and very little policing by the group that’s supposed to oversee them. So there are rules that Trump is taking advantage of that others have plowed before him. There are rules that he’s expanding. But I would say that this is not just a Trump issue. This is just the broader regime of campaign finance, that how we run this stuff is no longer a thing that makes intuitive sense to a regular American. Yeah. I wanted to ask specifically about the Truth Social, Trump Media, as he’s turned into a source of revenue. I’ve only been halfway following this storyline. I guess help me understand how something can become such a campaign boon or was it — or has it been? Yeah, so this is his private social media company. And it just went public. And on paper, Trump has become a multi-billionaire in a way that he really hasn’t been. And so it’s a dramatic increase in his wealth on paper. This is a stock that when they have to also file all these official reports now that you’re a publicly traded stock, you have to reveal your books, and the books don’t look like a multi-billion dollar company, right? There’s nothing in the books that — it’s like $4.1 million of revenue last year — that screams multi-billion dollar company. But what it does have is supporters who are buying this stock online and driving up the price. And we’ve seen this not just for Trump. We saw it in all these meme stocks around — GameStop. GameStop, AMC, right? And it bears a lot of similarities. The actual finances don’t merit the valuations that it has on the market. But it is valued at what it’s valued. Now, Trump is the biggest shareholder. And so, again, multi-billion dollar windfall. But he can’t sell those shares yet. There’s a bunch of rules about how long he has to wait. And so all of this is really like theoretical money for him, and certainly very theoretical in terms of the campaign. I would actually pretty much wall that off, because, for now, that isn’t money he has access to, and it’s not expected to immediately impact the campaign. So that doesn’t impact those initial three buckets, but it gives him a money on paper that he can possibly leverage to solve one of his many other problems. Hope on the horizon. Got you. Got you. What about these $60 bibles? Should we just expect a level of Trump gimmickiness to raise money? I guess I look at those things — and he’s always felt someone willing to grift, to sell, to do whatever he needs to. Is your sense that we’re entering a moment of desperation for them? How should I read the Bibles? I wouldn’t read it as something different in kind, right? You go back to 2016 when he was winning those competitive primaries, and he had Trump-branded stuff all around him. He was using that as a sales pitch opportunity. He went to Sneaker Con to roll out his own set of sneakers. Yes. Right? He has rolled out his own picture book? Yeah, a Bible is, I guess, just the next step in the journey. The Bible is just — I mean, it’s hard to say it’s just the next step, but it’s certainly a step, right? But we’ve been on this pathway for a long time, right? Trump selling his name to sell things and make a profit — and again, this is money for him personally. This is not a Bible that you buy it from his campaign that the campaign — this is just a personal private business deal that he’s entered into. Oh this isn’t even helping these buckets. This is just helping his own individual bank account, which he is not famously tapping to pay the lawyers. Or for his campaign, right? He has not put money into his own political campaign basically since he became the nominee in 2016. He relied on donors in the Republican Party ever since. That was such a huge part of his brand when he was running in 2016. It was like, I am not owned by these people. I mean, you talk to voters all the time. It is still part of his brand. That’s what I’m saying. Republican voters bring this up all the time. That’s exactly what I was going to say is, it’s amazing how that brand has lasted. But it hasn’t in our reporting seeped into anyone. And I was going to ask you, have you heard someone think, oh, Donald Trump with less money is a less appealing Donald Trump? I mean, I think some of this is just the media silos and what is the information that you’re consuming. But I think on a regular basis and traveling in Iowa and New Hampshire and other parts of the country this year, last year during the primary, voters would bring up his independence and say he doesn’t need to be running. He doesn’t need the money. That he is not beholden the way that Nikki Haley is beholden. He’s not beholden the way that Ron DeSantis is beholden. And meanwhile he is raising all the money from other people. But it was that initial spend that was his own money. And his vast claims of wealth and his idea that he didn’t need their money, even if he’s taking it, that has taken hold in such a real way that it’s hard to overstate how important that’s been in his appeal, I think not just to Republican primary voters, but across the board. Yeah, it is a core part of the brand, even if it’s gotten further from the truth. I want to ask, what do you think are the long-term impacts of this current cash crunch with Trump? When it comes to the campaign, what will he not be spending money on? What will we not see from the campaign that, otherwise, if he was flush, we would have seen? We’re talking a lot about money, but I think that money is often vastly overrated — That was my next question. — in its importance in presidential elections, in particular. I’ve covered House races and Senate races. And an average House candidate running, they’re not known in their community. Even the best House candidates aren’t particularly well known. So if somebody comes and spends $1 million on television ads, that dominates the average voter’s knowledge of those candidates. With Donald Trump and Joe Biden, a bunch of advertising isn’t introducing you to these two candidates. You know who these candidates are. You even know some of their positions on issues, right? And so money is incredibly important in American politics. It is least important in the biggest races. Right. I guess with that in mind, then, what does it do? It does a few things. I mean, the number one thing I think that it does is it allows the candidate or the campaign with more money to expand the map of what they’re looking at at presidential politics, right? If you are the Joe Biden campaign and you know that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are your absolute must win states, you want to hold those three — you hold those three states and you win the one little electoral college vote in Nebraska, you can get reelected, right? But that’s not where they’re spending exclusively. They’re also spending in Nevada, in Georgia, in Arizona. They just released a memo about Florida. They’re releasing a memo about Florida. But let’s see if they spend real money in Florida. But North Carolina, which they lost last time, right? Even as he won by a relatively large electoral college, they are spending in a state that he lost by the most narrow margin because they have enough right now to spread the map. So if you’re the Democrats, elections aren’t usually won in the winter spring before the election. But you can get an edge. If you’re Joe Biden, you enter this campaign behind in most public polling. The money is allowing you to either close that gap or build things, like campaign offices, that can pay off over time. But it’s really how thin can you stretch the defenses of your opponent. Can you make them need to spend money in North Carolina, if you’re Trump, and take away from the state that he may otherwise have to win? Right. And so speaking of the importance of this period of the race, the place we have seen the Biden campaign be the weakest is probably with enthusiasm among core constituencies. They talk a lot about bringing people home right now, and wanting to do that even more so than they think about persuasion or all that type of things come later in the year. What do we think about the impact of money? How much love can money buy? When you think about the impact of that, specifically the people who are probably Democrats but maybe soft on Biden, is that ads that they’re supposed to convince them? Is that texts? Is that door knocking? I guess it’s all of the above? Yeah, I mean, I think that the most recent “New York Times” poll we did had Trump winning 97 percent of the people who voted for him in 2020 and had Joe Biden winning 83 percent of the people who voted for him in 2020. That gap tells you why Joe Biden was losing in that poll. And so what they’re going to try to do is use their money advantage to tell that chunk of Democratic voters this election is coming. And depending on the place, give them a reason to care or to highlight their awareness, right? I live this every day. You live this every day. This is not a central part of most people’s lives. And if you’re an average voter, the whole promise of Joe Biden was partly I didn’t need to care about politics every day. And so people have intentionally tuned out. And so they’re trying to re-engage voters who might be likely to vote for Joe Biden but not likely to be tuned into why they should care yet. And sometimes that’s advertising. Sometimes that’s spending in other ways that are trying to reach them. But that is their chief goal. And money is one of the ways they’re trying to solve it. Thanks, Shane. I really appreciate it. This was really helpful. All right, thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] As of Wednesday morning, just as Shane and Robert predicted, Republican fundraising numbers were going up. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign announced that they’d raised over $65 million in March, ending the month with $93 million in cash on hand. The Biden campaign has yet to release its March total, though a campaign spokesperson said we can expect the numbers in the coming days. [MUSIC PLAYING] That’s “The Run-Up” for Thursday, April 4, 2024. And now the rundown. All right, this morning, counting votes in four states that had presidential primaries. Voters in Wisconsin, New York, Rhode Island, and Connecticut went to the polls on Tuesday. And although Biden and Trump won all those states easily, there were warning signs for both campaigns. On the Republican side — This primary is long over, but look at the support for Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley won at least 10 percent of the vote in all four states, despite having dropped out of the race last month. And on the Democratic side — More than 45,000 people in Wisconsin voted uninstructed. That’s the terminology. — people continued to voice their disagreement with Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza by staging a protest vote at the ballot box. Also this week — [CHANTING] — Donald Trump held rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin. And in his speeches — Under crooked Joe Biden, every state is now a border state. Every town is now a border town. — his rhetoric about immigration escalated. The 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia who was barbarically murdered by an illegal alien animal. The Democrats say, please don’t call them animals. They’re humans. I said, no, they’re not humans. They’re not humans. They’re animals. He used dehumanizing language about migrants — But it’s a border bloodbath, and it’s destroying our country. It’s a very bad thing happening. — and called what’s happening at the border a bloodbath. There are now 102 days till the Republican National Convention, 137 days till the Democratic National Convention, and 215 days till the general election. See you next week. “The Run-Up” is reported by me, Astead Herndon, and produced by Elisa Gutierrez, Caitlin O’Keefe, and Anna Foley.

[MUSIC PLAYING]  and  Last week, President Biden, flanked by former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, came to Radio City Music Hall for what Mr. Biden’s campaign called “the most successful political fund-raiser in American history.” The three Democratic presidents, alongside celebrities like Stephen Colbert, Mindy Kaling, Lizzo and Queen Latifah, spoke to an audience of 5,000 donors. According to the Biden campaign, the event brought in more than $25 million.  That fund-raising haul further tips the scales in the money race between Donald J. Trump and Mr. Biden — a race that, so far, the Democrats have been winning. But Mr. Biden’s big cash advantage hasn’t helped solve his political problems. And when two candidates are as well known as Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, there might be a limit to what money can buy. This week, we speak with the longtime Democratic donor Robert Wolf about the Radio City fund-raiser and why he has donated to Mr. Biden. And Shane Goldmacher, a national political correspondent for The New York Times, explains the vast financial gap between the candidates. “The Run-Up” is your guide to understanding the 2024 election.

One thing I’ve learned about presidential campaigns is that you’ll almost never catch a candidate in New York City, unless, of course, they need to raise some money. [MUSIC PLAYING] And last week, that was the case, when three US presidents, Biden, Obama, and Clinton, all gathered at Radio City Music Hall for what the Biden campaign called, quote, “The most successful political fundraiser in American history.” And we just have to take their word for it, in part, because we weren’t able to get in. But here’s the gist — tickets started at $250 on the low end and $100,000 on the high end, which got you a photo with all three presidents, an entrance to a private reception. There were performances by Queen Latifah, Lizzo, and an appearance from Stephen Colbert. In the end, the campaign says it raised more than $25 million. But this wasn’t just another gathering of the rich and famous. It’s an example of something the Biden campaign has done really well — courting big donors, and just, in general, raising a lot of money. In February alone, the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party raised $53 million, bringing their total cash on hand, as of the beginning of March, to $155 million. That’s more than $50 million ahead of where Donald Trump and the RNC say their current fundraising totals are, which, theoretically, should allow Biden’s campaign to build out a more robust operation than their opponents. But to this point, Biden’s money advantage is yet to solve his political problems, like weak poll numbers against Trump, continued concerns about his advanced age, and the enduring critiques of the administration’s role in the war in Gaza. That cropped up at Radio City when activists disrupted the event several times. So with the general election in its early stages, I wanted to check in on the dollars and cents of 2024, on Biden’s impressive totals, Trump’s financial situation, and all the things money can’t buy. Today, it’s all about the Benjamins. From “The New York Times,” I’m Astead Herndon. This is “The Run-Up.” So I’ve been going to political fundraisers for over two decades. And I will tell you that night was electric. I wanted to talk with someone who did get in to that Radio City event. Indulge me with some snoopy questions, like, did you see anybody cool, or were the biggest celebrities the presidents themselves? Well, without a question, the biggest celebrities were the presidents. This is Robert Wolf. He sat in the orchestra. I have to admit, for me, I went with my wife, and it felt like a great date night. We don’t come to the city all that often. And so it was great to see Queen Latifah before, and Lizzo, and Ben Platt, and people that I wouldn’t necessarily go see perform. And obviously Colbert as the moderator, he’s going to be funny, right? There’s a lot of tongue in cheek there. So for me it was kind of like — it was just a fun night. Wolf is a prolific Democratic fundraiser and Wall Street veteran. Most of my career I was on Wall Street at Salomon Brothers for about a decade. And then I moved to UBS, where I was there 18 years as the former CEO and chairman of the Americas and President and COO of the investment bank globally. Wolf was an early fundraiser for Obama, an informal advisor to his presidential campaign. And like a lot of big donors, he later served in Obama’s administration, including on the Economic Recovery Advisory Board after the 2008 financial crisis. He’s also what’s been called a bundler. I can’t say I love the name, but bundler is you raise money and then you race other people. So let’s just say I am going to an event, and I ask 10 other people to give $10,000 each, and they do. Then Robert Wolf will have not only his $10,000 assigned to him, but also that extra $100,000. And if you raise X amount of money, you get invited to fun things. It’s a way to supercharge your ability to donate as an organizer of other people’s money along with your own. Correct. Got it. And I’m not a bundler today. Now Wolf serves on the Biden campaign’s national finance committee, an elite group of some of its biggest donors. So he’s well known in Democratic circles and is well appreciated for his insights and his wallet. I thought he would be a good person to give me the lay of the land when it comes to big money in politics. How does it work? And what should we expect when it comes to big donors and President Biden? So I had the honor of seeing President Biden where I was able to chat with him in January, at a fundraiser in New York City. For me, I’m not there to ask for anything. I’m there to thank him, to let him know — thank him what he’s doing on gun violence, or thank him what he’s doing with respect to Ukraine. My wife and — How does that — how much money does that take? It was expensive. Can I know how much? I think — I think we wrote a check that night — it was high. I think — I just don’t know what the scale of high is. I mean, listen, you can write checks as low as $1 and $10. I think we wrote a check for $50,000 for that dinner. OK. We’ve spent money on politics over the last 20 years. One other question I have is, just how much have you spent do you think in aggregate, and is there a single thing — is the $50,000 the most you’ve written for a thing? No. What’s the most one check you’ve written? I think it was $100,000. For what campaign? Hillary’s. For Hillary’s? Yeah. And how much do you think you’ve probably given in aggregate? I think you can look at the non-PAC side or non-committee side — I mean, my guess is, in aggregate — I mean, my guess is in excess of a million dollars we’ve given. How did you get into political giving and fundraising period? Well, I appreciate that. Back in the early 2000s, for the most part it was called FIRE, Finance, Insurance and Real Estate. And if you looked at everyone giving, the top people, the top companies were either finance, insurance, or real estate. At that time, I was a senior executive at UBS. Being on Wall Street, being a senior executive, it got you the opportunity to meet a lot of people. So I got involved early, specifically with the Kerry campaign. OK. I was anti-Bush. I was against the war. I had two young boys. And I just felt like, at that time, it’s not the direction I wanted to go. And so I got very active with Kerry. And then it’s the list you can’t get off of. If you can get me off of, let me know how. But it’s the gift that keeps on giving. And then I hosted the first fundraiser for President, then-Senator, Obama in New York in March of ‘07. We raised a ton of money, and I became one of his biggest fundraisers nationally. Again — and I guess, does that just — do you just text your phone and say, hey, I have this politician, I think he’s really interesting? What’s actually the process of translating your interest in somebody to a larger group, and then the money part, too. Yeah, so it was interesting, in 2007, most of the Democratic Party was all in Hillary. I was able to meet Obama. I aligned with a lot. It was like that bro card. We’re both Ivy League guys. We both like sports. His mother died of cancer. My dad was going through cancer. All those things — He was against the war part was big, too, especially — And then against the war. And so what happened was I just invited people — like, hey, you should meet this guy. And they all knew of him from the 2004 convention, with his famous speech, “It’s not red state, blue state. We’re the United States,” so on and so forth. And so what happened was I became that guy. People at law firms wanted to meet him, even if it was just to meet him or get their book signed that he had — “Audacity of Hope”— or take a picture with him. People wanted to get to know this guy. And it was a cheap date back then. It was only like $2,100. And so they’re like — they could meet him and at a fairly accessible price. Exactly. Is it access-driven? When you’re saying people wanted to sign a book, they want to meet him, what is the incentive, if we’re thinking about why people want to give? I mean, politics is an aphrodisiac, right? You’re the most powerful person in the world at that time. Most people did not get the opportunity to meet a president in their life, and here’s a possibility to meet someone that could become the president. I get what you’re saying. You’re saying, particularly when you were getting started, what you were able to connect people with is an ability to meet people they wanted to. And they have the means and access to be able to do it through you. Yeah. I mean, I became kind of that guy. I mean, I guess — again, I’m still thinking broadly before we talk about Biden specifically — what is the brand like for Democrats among Wall Street right now? And how has that shifted maybe over the time in which we’re talking about? Yeah. I think it was always about 40 percent were staunch Democrats, 40 percent were staunch Republicans, because of Reaganomics, which is when I started Wall Street in the ‘80s, and 20 percent would go either way. And that — That’s kind of surprising to me. I think of that as more of a Republican crowd, maybe. It’s not because there’s a lot of other issues important to them. And not everyone votes with their pocketbook. I know that they think — they view us as banksters instead of bankers. But what I would say is that — I would say when it was McCain/Obama, it was clearly — Obama got, I’d say, 100 percent of the 20 percent. When it was Romney/Obama, I would say Romney was the majority of Wall Street. He was kind of a Wall Street guy, knew them all. I think with Clinton and Trump, in my opinion, I think Hillary and Bill just are so well-liked in New York. And my gut tells me there were Republicans that went her way, not for Trump as well. And then on the Biden/Trump, it’s hard to even assess because it was such a crazy period. There was no real campaign. Yeah. I mean, I don’t even know. I was going to ask you about that. And I guess I’m asking about right now, too, is there a sense — I’ve heard you previously talk about the ways that you think the progressive wing of Democrats has become too anti-Wall Street. I’m wondering where you view the Biden Democratic Party on that question. And do you think that the party right now makes it easy for you to pitch them to your fellow Wall Street folks? I mean, honestly, I don’t think we’re front and center. Wall Street’s not who it was and what it was. You can raise money from anywhere in almost any sector there is. I mean, media companies and everyone — tech companies. I don’t have to tell you how many firms now lobby. I guess that’s part of what I’m asking. Has small dollar donations has the ability to raise money from other groups changed it? Yeah, grassroots are — it’s more important to get grassroots money than my couple grand or whatever I give — a little more than that — but what I would say is that, first of all, Wall Street wants to give their economic view. They don’t like necessarily to get in the middle of the riff raff because I think they’re nervous about being the meme or being in a polarizing environment with their employees, right? I think voting is very personal today. And there is no generic Wall Street voter anymore. This idea that the progressives think that Wall Street is voting with their pocketbook I think is BS. They may care about climate more than the progressives care about climate, or they may care about gun reform. Gun reform, for me, is front and center. My wife works at Sandy Hook Promise on gun violence prevention and mental health. And so gun violence, for me, is front and center. So y’all are one issue voters in the — Yeah, I would say there is no one issue voter. It used to be because of Reaganomics, right? Taxes, right, or anti-regulation. That’s changed dramatically. The other thing — and this is going to get to Biden specifically — is we have been talking to so many people about how this election puts them in a kind of pickle, because for the majority of Americans, they talk about wanting other options or just being not happy with having the same options again. When you’re in those circles, how is your community feeling about Biden right now? Which community? [LAUGHS] Yeah, that’s a good question. Because I have two sons in their late 20s and that would be — I would be curious about them. That would be a very different conversation. We could — I would hear that answer. But I’m really specific to — I was thinking specific to fundraisers. Is it easy to raise money for Biden right now? The answer is yes. It’s easy because there’s now a campaign. It’s Trump versus Biden. And President Biden was not candidate Biden. So this whole idea of Democratic bedwetters, or, hey, he’s got to get out, I was totally the other way. In my opinion, that transition to becoming more of the candidate took place at the State of the Union. And that State of the Union, in my opinion, I thought he was fantastic. I think he has a hop in his step. I love that he’s now out and about. I like that Kamala — Vice President Harris — I’m sorry, I’ve known her a long time. No, it’s OK. I think I love that she’s out and about. And now we’re in a campaign. People are more active and engaged. Yeah. It’s interesting you’re — I like that you’re pointing to State of the Union as that hinge point because it did feel like there was — the bedwetting had reached its peak right before then, right? There was — whether it was the age questions from the special counsel, whether it was a polling — The calls I was getting. I want to hear about those. No, insane. I want to hear about — what were people — are you someone who feels the angst when people are angsty? It was insane. I was getting calls, you know, why is he running? Do you think he should run? Hey, he’s running. Let’s not even have that discussion. Let’s talk about he’s running and who he’s going to be competing against. And let’s put all of our inner anxiety into helping him win. But I was fielding calls nonstop because, listen, people were seeing President Trump and Nikki Haley — they were in campaign mode. Yeah. So yes, I was fielding it as that nonstop. Age, specifically, or other stuff? I think other stuff. I think, age — I think there was just — listen, there was a nervousness. Can anyone beat Trump? The answer is yes. And now we’re in a situation where it’s much more mano a mano. And we now have choices to make. And forget about what was. Let’s look at what is. Well, let me ask something different then. Yeah. Why aren’t your sons convinced? My sons are very convinced that they will be voting for President Biden versus President Trump. But we were talking, you and I, about the excitement and the issues. Yeah. Our dinner table issues are about Gaza and humanitarian — there’s a big debate going on in the Gen Z’s generation versus the older generation. There’s a debate going on on climate action versus I’m for I’m glad that we’re energy independent. These debates are becoming talked about more and more often. Because I said to you, this idea that democracy is on the line or these cultural issues are more front and center, they are more front and center. I would have never thought, when I was 27 or 29-and-a-half years old, like my boys — I don’t think about the things they think about today because they weren’t front and center to me. One question I have is, do you see what you do in terms of raising money as helping them get there to close that enthusiasm gap? How do you actually view the role of fundraising versus the work that they have to do to pull this off? Money is critical. Let’s not underestimate that. Yes, both sides will be able to have a lot of money. But getting out the vote, getting data, having the right research, being both on paid media and promoted media, having a bunch of people work with the grassroots, that’s important. To think that politics isn’t local, to think that you can do this national campaign and win, that’s complete BS. People are tuning out — most people cut the cord. So the people that you have to get to, you got to be local. So I’m — this idea that raising $26 million is anything other than fantastic is ridiculous. Interesting, because right now there’s a lot of talk about how Trump can’t raise a lot of money. How much do we think a money advantage matters? How much does a money disadvantage matter? Donald Trump has no problem getting on media, right? He has no problem in that type of space. What do you think the money advantage can do for Biden? What do you hope it can do? So I think there’s a bunch to unpack there. Yes, Donald Trump, in some ways, owns the airwaves. You wake up to him. You go to sleep to him. But those are national airwaves. That’s not where voting gets done. So the answer is, yes, it’s important to localize the campaign. It’s important to tell someone in a certain area how they’re helping your wages, or how they’re helping with climate action, or why it’s important that you’re doing red flag laws in certain states on gun violence. The second part I would say is don’t underestimate President Trump. He’s going to be able to raise his money. I’ve said this the other day. Mar-a-Lago is not some homeless shelter, OK? So it’s not like he doesn’t have billionaires sitting there. The rumors of Trump is broke are overblown. [LAUGHS] I mean, that’s complete BS, right? Because you’re going to have — his tax policy is going to be front and center. And so these billionaires, some do vote one dimensional. They’re going to make sure that he’s got money to run on. Yeah, this is helpful because a lot of what we’re reading now is about the lack of funds. You’re saying you trust that in the end, maybe it’s because of tax policy or just because of people’s investment in Republicans, folks will give to him. I think — listen, I want to be clear here. I think President Biden’s going to outraise him. I think we’re going to outwork him. And I think having money early is important for building offices. I get what you’re saying. But if you’re telling me that we don’t think that there’s going to be money at the RNC or the Republican Party for a presidential election where the Senate is important and the House is important, we’re kidding ourselves. Yeah. When you look about the next six months, is there a thing that worries you the most for the prospect of Biden getting reelected? Listen, I think if it’s President Biden versus former President Trump, I think we’re in a good seat. I don’t think there’s more people voting for President Trump than in the past, and I think it would be less. I am worried about the third party situation because we saw what happened with Secretary Clinton. There was no question the third party impacted Secretary Clinton. And so, yeah, I’m nervous of what a third party can — how it impacts us. And if I asked the most brilliant people or pollsters in the world, they could not give me an answer because they don’t know. We don’t know. So, yeah, I’m a Wall Street guy. I buy and sell things. I don’t live great in this gray area. OK, I just don’t. Do you — and this is kind of the last question — I’m like, Citizens United, super PACs, there was so much talk about the influence of money in politics. What’s your assessment of it? Do you think campaigns are too expensive? Do you think there’s too much money in it? Do you think that maybe money doesn’t matter as much as folks saying and it’s all a little overblown? No, yes, there’s way too much money in it. It’s insane. We’re going to spend billions and billions of dollars on this presidential election. And, yeah, there’s too much money in it. And for some, it’s transactional, being an ambassador, being this. That’s not where I am. But I guess to most people, this is the most important thing that they think about every four years. So it seems like it’s too much money at it, but then again, if you’re saying the most important thing that happens every four years, I don’t know, it doesn’t seem that much versus our annual GDP. Yeah, I hear what you’re saying. Well, thank you. I appreciate your time. Thank you for joining us. Thank you. Much appreciated. After the break, the other side of the money race. After talking to Robert Wolf, I wanted to get a bigger picture of the role of money in this race, especially on the Republican side where Trump has been lagging behind in donations while facing mounting legal bills. There’s also the $175 million bond he just paid, the social media company going public, and those $60 bibles he started selling. Well, thank you for joining us. Sorry. I cough right before we start. No, it’s all good. It’s all good. You’re just allergic to me. So I brought in my colleague, Shane Goldmacher, national political correspondent for “The Times” and the person I usually go to when I have questions about money and politics. I started by asking him what to make of Biden’s big money advantage and Trump’s financial struggles. It’s a big gap. And I think the issue isn’t just the size of the gap right now. It’s the potential size of the gap in the coming months, because, by all accounts, Democrats are expected to raise more money in the coming months than Republicans are. So that’s the gap now, and it’s expected to get even bigger — Oh, wow. Interesting. — throughout the rest of the race. What is the cause of it? I mean, one of them is just a general structural cause, which is the candidate who’s sitting in the White House tends to enter the general election with more money. Why is that? Just because people like giving money to the president? Some of it is people like giving money to the president. But more important is that they have controlled the party apparatus for the three years leading up to the beginning of the general election. And so Joe Biden has been raising money with the Democratic Party for basically a year at this point. And it gives you an advantage because Trump was raising in much tinier increments just to fight through the primary. Just to give you a sense of scale, during the primary, Donald Trump was raising $3,300 increments to win that Republican primary. That’s the most he could raise from an individual person into his campaign account. Joe Biden was going around the country and raising in this big mega committee that he shares with the Democratic Party — $929,000 increments. And so you end up with a lot more money if you can raise in that big of a chunk. You’re able to ask for more. You’re able to ask for more. You have smaller donors that you can then fund by using those bigger contributions to advertise to get more small donors. It sort of builds upon itself. Interesting. Why does it cost so much, and increasingly costs more, for these campaigns? I mean, theoretically, these are two candidates the country knows. These aren’t people who have name recognition problems. Why exactly are campaigns so expensive? I mean, the number one answer is television ads or the digital version of television ads. And, look, you can spend an enormous amount of money on television really, really quickly. Just think about Mike Bloomberg’s campaign when he ran for president, right? He ran for president for only a few months, and he spent basically a billion dollars. He was blanketing the television ads for a period. But it is a reminder of how high up that number can run. If you’re buying as many TV ads as you can, it’s basically an unlimited amount of spending that you can go. And so what is the driver? The driver is television ads, first and foremost, and digital ads that now run on television. A lot of people are streaming. But, yeah, running advertising is the overwhelming cost. Everything else you hear about — our field program, our ground game — it tends to be fractions of the dollars spent on advertising on television. Interesting. So what is driving that big advantage that you’re talking about? Do we know where the money gap is coming from? Does Biden have a specific advantage among small donors, big donors? How would we break down why he has so much more money on hand? I think there’s important to think about in two timeframes. The first is right now. And I think he has more money right now because he’s been tapping those bigger institutional donors. Got it. Those people can give large chunks of money. The big Radio City thing we saw last week. Correct. They had 5,000 people in the room. So there’s a lot of smaller donors. You know what, there were also people raising or giving $100,000, that they were going to get a picture with the presidents, right? The next day, he had a smaller gathering of 175 of his donors in New York City. Those people got personalized briefings from the entire senior campaign team. How much did that cost you? You had to, I think, at least given $47,000 something, right? That is the entry level. The highest tier for his bundlers — $2.5 million. Wow. Now, if you’re raising $2.5 million, you might not be going to a big group briefing. You might be getting the president visiting your house on a fundraiser. But there’s enough people that, at a roughly $50,000 limit, you still have 175 of them coming to New York for that personalized briefing. So your first question, where is his advantage right now, it’s a lot of these major donors. They have been tapped. They’ve built out a whole system. Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff, they’ve been traveling around the country at events and scooping up big checks. In the coming months, though, there’s a wider expectation that Joe Biden’s advantage will be driven by smaller donors online, that online Democratic giving has become almost habitual for liberal donors who are amped up about an election, even about the candidates they may not be excited about. They give tons of money, right? Key Senate races are flooded with money each cycle. And whether the Democrat’s a household name or not, they end up raising a lot of money. And there’s a wide expectation that online, even if Democrats aren’t enthused about Joe Biden, they’re going to be enthused about giving money to stop Donald Trump. OK. Let’s focus now on Donald Trump, someone who famously has a lot of money until he doesn’t. Why is he struggling in fundraising so much, considering he has historically done well with small dollar donors. And it seems like what you’re saying, those donations are slowing down. Why is that? Do we know? Yeah, I mean, let me give you an answer — I want to take one little step back, which is that Trump is facing multiple different financial challenges all at once. It’s hard to keep them straight. It is hard to keep them straight. So number one, you’re talking about is politics. How much money does he have in his campaign account? And some of that is, look, he just got through a nominating contest, and he was raising money and spending money to win the nomination. Now, less than maybe some others have before. Usually, at the end of that, you end up with a little bit less and you have to build up. And he hasn’t had that joint agreement with the Republican Party until just now, basically, to raise those bigger chunks of money. In fact, he’s doing that. Just this coming week he has a big event in Palm Beach that they’ve said they’re going to raise $25, $30 million — I think they put out the number $33 million — from a single dinner, because he’s getting all these people who have not given till now. To do that. They’re going to come, and a couple — each member of the couple gives $800,000. That’s $1.6 million for that couple at that dinner. So this is his answer to Radio City. This is his answer — it’s his coming out party for those mega donors checks. This weekend. It’s just coming this week. So the first financial challenge is political, and he just has less money than Joe Biden does. The second one is his legal bills. And he has been spending — now, we’ve reported more than $100 million since he left the White House on legal bills. And the pot of money he’s been tapping for that mostly has been this money raised in the aftermath of the 2020 election. And that money is almost all gone at this point. Is that a different pot than the money he was spending to win the primary? It is a completely different pot. So what happened is, at the end of 2020, he loses the election. And he says, “Please give to me, dear supporters. This thing was rigged. And there’s no evidence of this yet, but I’m going to fight this in the courts. I’m going to fight it everywhere I can. My Election Defense Fund.” And Republican donors gave more money to Donald Trump in the post-election period of 2020 than almost any period they gave during the actual campaign. That is so wild. They were so — — denying the election result paid off for him. He raised $250 million online between the day after the election in the day that Joe Biden was inaugurated. So he spent some of that money fighting recounts or whatever. But you know what, he pocketed most of that money — not personally pocketed, but he put it in a Political Action Committee. And that huge chunk of funds paid has been paying his lawyers ever since then. And so that money has been spent down slowly, slowly, now quickly and quickly. And the total amount of money left in the account that’s been doing that — Save America — it’s his Political Action Committee — is less than $5 million at this point. So he’s basically tapped out that post-2020 surge of money that he got through people giving out of the election denial space. Correct. And so he’s facing not just a political shortfall versus Joe Biden, but this legal fund that he’s been using to pay his lawyers, that’s also going to be in a shortfall. And by the way, he’s going on a trial soon. The costs don’t go down typically when you go on a criminal trial. Yeah, the legal problems have no signs of slowing in terms of what he has to owe. Correct. So the first one is that political. The second is this legal. And the third one, we have a little bit of resolution right now, but it has been a big one, has been the bond he had to post in order to keep all of his businesses active during his appeal on one of the many cases he’s faced, which is a civil fraud case in New York. And that just went down. From what I understand, “The Times” reported he posted a $175 million bond in his civil fraud case, which means that the New York authorities can’t seize his assets while he’s appealing that larger $450 million judgment against him. Can you just explain what that means in more simple terms? Yeah, that third category is like can he keep his businesses and can they keep running in New York? Because the risk was that if he could not pay that, he would have to sell off the businesses to pay said judgment. Yeah, so he has lost the case. And he’s appealing that ruling. And under New York law, when you lose, you still have to pay, basically, the penalty. And so he’s saying the penalty is so big — it was $454 million — it’s so onerous that I can’t even get a bond to do that. And so that has been reduced. So it’s now $175 million. And he has since lined up money. And so it’s like you’re borrowing in order to appeal. And eventually, look, if he loses at the appellate court level and he loses at the final final court, then he will have to make an actual payment. But for now, he can borrow a bond to stave off making those payments. And does that actual payment have to be $450 or $175? As of now, it’s still the $450. But some of the legal experts say the fact that the bond itself was being reduced is maybe a sign that eventually a final judgment could be shrunk. But we don’t know yet. We previously talked to Maggie Haberman about how Trump’s legal fees were basically consuming the campaign in the way that you really just laid out for us. But one thing I couldn’t understand is, like, what are the possible solutions he has to this? I know we have seen some of the efforts with things like Truth Social, his social media company, and other ways he’s been trying to maneuver. I remember hearing about the RNC having an open question about whether they would do it. What is his best shot to come up with some of these answers? I mean, the number one thing to remember is that he could, of course, pay for his own lawyers with his own money. He’s chosen not to do so so far, right? He has chosen not to use his own personal finances to pay for his attorneys. Oh, you’re right. All these buckets are separate from Donald Trump’s bank account. He could choose to use his bank account to solve the issue that he’s running out of money to pay his lawyers. He’s just running out of other people’s money. It doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have any money. [LAUGHS]: That is an important reminder. Right? He has his own set of money that he has chosen not to use to pay his lawyers in his multiple criminal cases because he had this big pot of money from 2020. So option one is you just pay for them yourself. There’s other more complicated options like you create a special legal defense fund. And what are the rules around that if you’re an active candidate for president? There are other ways he can raise money into the PAC that has been paying the lawyers. And in fact, he’s done a small thing along those lines. There was a little float — well, will the RNC actually pay his legal bills? And they said, no, absolutely not. But then that first mega committee we talked about — you can raise those really big checks — there’s a order of operations of who gets the money. The first always is the candidate. The candidate gets the money first. Typically, second is the party, like the Republican National Committee. But in this case, Trump didn’t actually put the party second. He put his PAC second. And that PAC has been paying his lawyers. So we see Trump coming up with these solutions. At this point, if I were to give $100 to Donald Trump’s campaign, do we know how much of that is going to Save America and the legal fees versus how much is going to the actual job of winning an actual election? Yeah, since early last year, $0.10 of every dollar that’s been given online has gone to that Save America account, which has paid almost exclusively for legal stuff. And so, yeah, all those small donors, it’s 10 percent of what they’ve been giving for the last year, which is not an insignificant amount of money and it’s helped pay for some of those. Look, the intertwining of all these things is real. To differentiate what is the Trump legal issues with what is the Trump political issues is kind of — it’s a fool’s errand, right? One of his lawyers was recently co-hosting a fundraiser for his super PAC, right? So they’re not totally separate. They have been separate in terms of actual cash flow. The campaign has not spent money on his personal lawyers. But the idea that they’re separate things — no, I think it’s very much the Donald Trump 2024 campaign is happening in and around courtrooms. I know this is a really unprecedented situation that we’re in. But are these rules being made up as we go along or like — That is an existential question. Yeah! It is kind of — I’m like — because we’ve never been here, is he just test casting new theories about how you use money in politics? Is it just completely uncharted? It’s a little bit uncharted. It’s also that it’s not just him, right? We’re in basically 20 years of candidates testing new theories of how they want to spend and raise money in politics and very little policing by the group that’s supposed to oversee them. So there are rules that Trump is taking advantage of that others have plowed before him. There are rules that he’s expanding. But I would say that this is not just a Trump issue. This is just the broader regime of campaign finance, that how we run this stuff is no longer a thing that makes intuitive sense to a regular American. Yeah. I wanted to ask specifically about the Truth Social, Trump Media, as he’s turned into a source of revenue. I’ve only been halfway following this storyline. I guess help me understand how something can become such a campaign boon or was it — or has it been? Yeah, so this is his private social media company. And it just went public. And on paper, Trump has become a multi-billionaire in a way that he really hasn’t been. And so it’s a dramatic increase in his wealth on paper. This is a stock that when they have to also file all these official reports now that you’re a publicly traded stock, you have to reveal your books, and the books don’t look like a multi-billion dollar company, right? There’s nothing in the books that — it’s like $4.1 million of revenue last year — that screams multi-billion dollar company. But what it does have is supporters who are buying this stock online and driving up the price. And we’ve seen this not just for Trump. We saw it in all these meme stocks around — GameStop. GameStop, AMC, right? And it bears a lot of similarities. The actual finances don’t merit the valuations that it has on the market. But it is valued at what it’s valued. Now, Trump is the biggest shareholder. And so, again, multi-billion dollar windfall. But he can’t sell those shares yet. There’s a bunch of rules about how long he has to wait. And so all of this is really like theoretical money for him, and certainly very theoretical in terms of the campaign. I would actually pretty much wall that off, because, for now, that isn’t money he has access to, and it’s not expected to immediately impact the campaign. So that doesn’t impact those initial three buckets, but it gives him a money on paper that he can possibly leverage to solve one of his many other problems. Hope on the horizon. Got you. Got you. What about these $60 bibles? Should we just expect a level of Trump gimmickiness to raise money? I guess I look at those things — and he’s always felt someone willing to grift, to sell, to do whatever he needs to. Is your sense that we’re entering a moment of desperation for them? How should I read the Bibles? I wouldn’t read it as something different in kind, right? You go back to 2016 when he was winning those competitive primaries, and he had Trump-branded stuff all around him. He was using that as a sales pitch opportunity. He went to Sneaker Con to roll out his own set of sneakers. Yes. Right? He has rolled out his own picture book? Yeah, a Bible is, I guess, just the next step in the journey. The Bible is just — I mean, it’s hard to say it’s just the next step, but it’s certainly a step, right? But we’ve been on this pathway for a long time, right? Trump selling his name to sell things and make a profit — and again, this is money for him personally. This is not a Bible that you buy it from his campaign that the campaign — this is just a personal private business deal that he’s entered into. Oh this isn’t even helping these buckets. This is just helping his own individual bank account, which he is not famously tapping to pay the lawyers. Or for his campaign, right? He has not put money into his own political campaign basically since he became the nominee in 2016. He relied on donors in the Republican Party ever since. That was such a huge part of his brand when he was running in 2016. It was like, I am not owned by these people. I mean, you talk to voters all the time. It is still part of his brand. That’s what I’m saying. Republican voters bring this up all the time. That’s exactly what I was going to say is, it’s amazing how that brand has lasted. But it hasn’t in our reporting seeped into anyone. And I was going to ask you, have you heard someone think, oh, Donald Trump with less money is a less appealing Donald Trump? I mean, I think some of this is just the media silos and what is the information that you’re consuming. But I think on a regular basis and traveling in Iowa and New Hampshire and other parts of the country this year, last year during the primary, voters would bring up his independence and say he doesn’t need to be running. He doesn’t need the money. That he is not beholden the way that Nikki Haley is beholden. He’s not beholden the way that Ron DeSantis is beholden. And meanwhile he is raising all the money from other people. But it was that initial spend that was his own money. And his vast claims of wealth and his idea that he didn’t need their money, even if he’s taking it, that has taken hold in such a real way that it’s hard to overstate how important that’s been in his appeal, I think not just to Republican primary voters, but across the board. Yeah, it is a core part of the brand, even if it’s gotten further from the truth. I want to ask, what do you think are the long-term impacts of this current cash crunch with Trump? When it comes to the campaign, what will he not be spending money on? What will we not see from the campaign that, otherwise, if he was flush, we would have seen? We’re talking a lot about money, but I think that money is often vastly overrated — That was my next question. — in its importance in presidential elections, in particular. I’ve covered House races and Senate races. And an average House candidate running, they’re not known in their community. Even the best House candidates aren’t particularly well known. So if somebody comes and spends $1 million on television ads, that dominates the average voter’s knowledge of those candidates. With Donald Trump and Joe Biden, a bunch of advertising isn’t introducing you to these two candidates. You know who these candidates are. You even know some of their positions on issues, right? And so money is incredibly important in American politics. It is least important in the biggest races. Right. I guess with that in mind, then, what does it do? It does a few things. I mean, the number one thing I think that it does is it allows the candidate or the campaign with more money to expand the map of what they’re looking at at presidential politics, right? If you are the Joe Biden campaign and you know that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are your absolute must win states, you want to hold those three — you hold those three states and you win the one little electoral college vote in Nebraska, you can get reelected, right? But that’s not where they’re spending exclusively. They’re also spending in Nevada, in Georgia, in Arizona. They just released a memo about Florida. They’re releasing a memo about Florida. But let’s see if they spend real money in Florida. But North Carolina, which they lost last time, right? Even as he won by a relatively large electoral college, they are spending in a state that he lost by the most narrow margin because they have enough right now to spread the map. So if you’re the Democrats, elections aren’t usually won in the winter spring before the election. But you can get an edge. If you’re Joe Biden, you enter this campaign behind in most public polling. The money is allowing you to either close that gap or build things, like campaign offices, that can pay off over time. But it’s really how thin can you stretch the defenses of your opponent. Can you make them need to spend money in North Carolina, if you’re Trump, and take away from the state that he may otherwise have to win? Right. And so speaking of the importance of this period of the race, the place we have seen the Biden campaign be the weakest is probably with enthusiasm among core constituencies. They talk a lot about bringing people home right now, and wanting to do that even more so than they think about persuasion or all that type of things come later in the year. What do we think about the impact of money? How much love can money buy? When you think about the impact of that, specifically the people who are probably Democrats but maybe soft on Biden, is that ads that they’re supposed to convince them? Is that texts? Is that door knocking? I guess it’s all of the above? Yeah, I mean, I think that the most recent “New York Times” poll we did had Trump winning 97 percent of the people who voted for him in 2020 and had Joe Biden winning 83 percent of the people who voted for him in 2020. That gap tells you why Joe Biden was losing in that poll. And so what they’re going to try to do is use their money advantage to tell that chunk of Democratic voters this election is coming. And depending on the place, give them a reason to care or to highlight their awareness, right? I live this every day. You live this every day. This is not a central part of most people’s lives. And if you’re an average voter, the whole promise of Joe Biden was partly I didn’t need to care about politics every day. And so people have intentionally tuned out. And so they’re trying to re-engage voters who might be likely to vote for Joe Biden but not likely to be tuned into why they should care yet. And sometimes that’s advertising. Sometimes that’s spending in other ways that are trying to reach them. But that is their chief goal. And money is one of the ways they’re trying to solve it. Thanks, Shane. I really appreciate it. This was really helpful. All right, thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] As of Wednesday morning, just as Shane and Robert predicted, Republican fundraising numbers were going up. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign announced that they’d raised over $65 million in March, ending the month with $93 million in cash on hand. The Biden campaign has yet to release its March total, though a campaign spokesperson said we can expect the numbers in the coming days. [MUSIC PLAYING] That’s “The Run-Up” for Thursday, April 4, 2024. And now the rundown. All right, this morning, counting votes in four states that had presidential primaries. Voters in Wisconsin, New York, Rhode Island, and Connecticut went to the polls on Tuesday. And although Biden and Trump won all those states easily, there were warning signs for both campaigns. On the Republican side — This primary is long over, but look at the support for Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley won at least 10 percent of the vote in all four states, despite having dropped out of the race last month. And on the Democratic side — More than 45,000 people in Wisconsin voted uninstructed. That’s the terminology. — people continued to voice their disagreement with Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza by staging a protest vote at the ballot box. Also this week — [CHANTING] — Donald Trump held rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin. And in his speeches — Under crooked Joe Biden, every state is now a border state. Every town is now a border town. — his rhetoric about immigration escalated. The 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia who was barbarically murdered by an illegal alien animal. The Democrats say, please don’t call them animals. They’re humans. I said, no, they’re not humans. They’re not humans. They’re animals. He used dehumanizing language about migrants — But it’s a border bloodbath, and it’s destroying our country. It’s a very bad thing happening. — and called what’s happening at the border a bloodbath. There are now 102 days till the Republican National Convention, 137 days till the Democratic National Convention, and 215 days till the general election. See you next week. “The Run-Up” is reported by me, Astead Herndon, and produced by Elisa Gutierrez, Caitlin O’Keefe, and Anna Foley.

[MUSIC PLAYING]  and  Last week, President Biden, flanked by former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, came to Radio City Music Hall for what Mr. Biden’s campaign called “the most successful political fund-raiser in American history.” The three Democratic presidents, alongside celebrities like Stephen Colbert, Mindy Kaling, Lizzo and Queen Latifah, spoke to an audience of 5,000 donors. According to the Biden campaign, the event brought in more than $25 million.  That fund-raising haul further tips the scales in the money race between Donald J. Trump and Mr. Biden — a race that, so far, the Democrats have been winning. But Mr. Biden’s big cash advantage hasn’t helped solve his political problems. And when two candidates are as well known as Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, there might be a limit to what money can buy. This week, we speak with the longtime Democratic donor Robert Wolf about the Radio City fund-raiser and why he has donated to Mr. Biden. And Shane Goldmacher, a national political correspondent for The New York Times, explains the vast financial gap between the candidates. “The Run-Up” is your guide to understanding the 2024 election. Through on-the-ground reporting and conversations with colleagues from The New York Times, newsmakers and voters across the country, our host, Astead W. Herndon, takes us beyond the horse race to explore how we came to this unprecedented moment in American politics. New episodes on Thursdays. “The Run-Up” is hosted by  Astead W.

The Rage in ‘Carrie’ Feels More Relevant Than Ever,"Advertisement Supported by Guest Essay Ms. Jayatissa is the author of three novels, most recently “Island Witch.” In “On Writing,” Stephen King’s nonfiction account of his career, he talks about a girl he calls Dodie Franklin. She attended his high school and, he recalls, was often bullied for wearing the same clothes every day. In their sophomore year, on the first day back after Christmas vacation, she came to school wearing newly fashionable clothes with a trendy hairstyle — but the bullying and teasing never stopped. “Her peers had no intention of letting her out of the box they’d put her in,” Mr. King writes. “She was punished for even trying to break free.” The realization that nothing could change Ms. Franklin’s social standing, coupled with a few more unfortunate examples of young women he knew, helped inform a story about a bullied girl with telekinetic powers who is pushed to her limits and who wreaks brutal revenge on her classmates and, eventually, her abusive mother. “Carrie,” Mr. King’s first published novel, was released 50 years ago, in 1974. There have been many iterations of “Carrie” since. Horror enthusiasts will recall the   directed by Brian De Palma and released in 1976; there have been several remakes, most recently one in 2013 starring Chloë Grace Moretz. There was an  , “Carrie: The Musical,” which the TV show “Riverdale” once paid   to. Many things have changed in the half-century since Mr. King’s novel was published, yet Carrie White remains a strikingly relevant and highly relatable figure. She raged her way to a place in pop culture’s pantheon. But why? I first read “Carrie” as a nerdy, horror-enthused 14-year-old growing up in Sri Lanka. At the library of the Christian school I attended, Mr. King’s books were extremely hard to come by, so when I saw a copy at a friend’s house, I was quick to borrow it. I vividly remember being drawn to Carrie’s wide-eyed gaze on the cover, blood trailing from her forehead and dripping down her chin. “Nobody was really surprised when it happened,” it reads in the opening pages. “Not really, not at the subconscious level where savage things grow.” I was hooked. What did Mr. King mean by “savage things”? I didn’t realize then that I would spend so much of my adult life thinking about this very question. I’ve reached for “Carrie” many times since, and my relationship with the story has continued to shift and evolve. Like most teenagers, I suppose, I initially reacted to Carrie’s story with pure horror; I was mortified by the way she was teased, repulsed by the pig’s blood that gets dumped over her at prom and fascinated by the death and destruction she wrought in retaliation. In my 20s, when I revisited the novel, the horror I felt at her tale turned to something closer to sympathy. By that point, I’d moved from Colombo to California to Britain and then back to my hometown in Sri Lanka and had chalked up enough life lessons to understand Carrie’s suffering in a different way. Now, as a woman in my 30s, I no longer see Carrie as simply a victim to be pitied. I’ve learned to relish her rage. Her anger has inspired much of my own fiction writing and, more important, has taught me that anger, when channeled, can be an asset. This truly hit home for me in July 2022, when I joined thousands of protesters in Colombo marching against corruption and the economic mismanagement of the country’s leaders. Years of feeling powerless finally erupted. We were all angry, of course, but we used our rage as fuel. In the past year, women in the United States have had many reasons to figuratively burn down auditoriums and destroy towns. The war on women is still very much alive, as Roe v. Wade was overturned, in vitro fertilization procedures were endangered in Alabama and pregnant women are still not allowed to divorce their husbands in Missouri. These days I see Carries everywhere. At the end of 2023, Gypsy Rose Blanchard — who had been convicted of second-degree murder in connection with the death of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, after years of being subjected to abuse and Munchausen syndrome by proxy — was   from prison. There are many interesting parallels between Gypsy Rose Blanchard and Carrie, the most glaring being the obvious torment of each by her mother. What struck me as most interesting (read: most depressing) was the public response Ms. Blanchard received after her release. While some hailed her as a folk hero, many labeled her a killer, much like Carrie, for fighting back against her tormentor — not just in a court of law but also in the court of social media. TikTok was rife with hot takes, arguing there was something sinister about Ms. Blanchard or claiming that her husband was actually her brother. Rather than being viewed as a young woman trying to navigate her way through an absolutely horrendous situation, she was criticized for participating in a television series. Many people seemed content when she was the victim, but it infuriated them when she tried to take a stand for herself. What was true of Mr. King’s account of Ms. Franklin proved true for Ms. Blanchard, too: “She was punished for even trying to break free.” Look at the way that Meghan Markle has been treated — criticized as an attention seeker for speaking out in a society that constantly blames women for staying silent. Or take Britney Spears. We all cried “Free Britney” and lamented the ignorance of our ways when we learned of how those in her life had treated her terribly, yet all it takes is a social media post of her dancing in clothes deemed by some to be too provocative to leave viewers shaking their heads at her again, saying she has gone off the deep end. God forbid women choose to fight back by simply expressing themselves in a way that defies convention. I believe we still too often look at women who fight back against their oppressors and see them as villains rather than assigning responsibility for their situations to the people who tormented them. Carrie has always been the antidote to that predicament: She forces us to confront our feelings about what happens when women instill some of the same fear in others that they are too often forced to deal with themselves. Carrie’s plight still speaks to feelings in women of rage, helplessness and a desire for justice or, failing that, retribution. None of that has gone away in 50 years. Beyond being a supremely well-told story, Mr. King’s novel still connects on the same “savage” subconscious level he mentioned at the start of the book. “Carrie” was packaged and marketed as horror, but what is it about the character of Carrie that’s truly horrifying? Is it the revenge that’s exacted by a bullied girl? Or is it the actions of those who stood around and allowed her to be tormented? The question at the heart of the story is: Who is the real monster? Fifty years later, we’ve come to understand that it’s not Carrie but the world that made her.

You Don’t Just See a Total Solar Eclipse. You Feel It Completely.,"Advertisement Supported by Guest Essay Dr. Milligan is a senior lecturer in astrophysics at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Almost one year ago, in the middle of the night, I drove from my hometown, Belfast, Northern Ireland, to Dublin to catch an early morning flight to Munich. From there I caught another plane to Bangkok, another to Singapore and yet another to Perth in Western Australia. There, I rented a camper van and began a drive of more than 750 miles north to the town of Exmouth on a remote peninsula on the northwest coast of the continent. This was the only reasonably accessible location on the planet with decent weather prospects from which to view the total solar eclipse on April 20, 2023. The entire event lasted 62 seconds. It was the 10th total solar eclipse I’d traveled to witness. Even as a professional solar physicist, I find it difficult to convey why eclipse chasers like me go to such extraordinary lengths to witness such a fleeting phenomenon, again and again. I was extra determined to make the pilgrimage last year after I was thwarted by clouds in Chile in December 2020, and I couldn’t afford the eye-watering cost of traveling to Antarctica in 2021. I needed to whet my appetite before embarking on another expedition to see the totality of the April 8 eclipse in Mazatlán, Mexico. It may sound absurd, but there is no other celestial event that anyone I know would devote so much time and effort to seeing. If you wish to see the northern lights, you can hop on a plane to Iceland or Norway and have a fairly decent chance of seeing them in the winter months. If you are on the nightside of the planet during a lunar eclipse and the skies are clear, you just need to go outside and look up to see it happening. But unless you are fortunate enough to live within or close to the path of totality, witnessing a total solar eclipse will probably require meticulous planning and marshaling time and money to get you to an optimal location and a bit of luck to make sure the weather forecasts you’ve pored over hold true. Believe me, it is worth the effort. A total solar eclipse is not something that you see — it’s something that you experience. You can feel the temperature around you begin to drop by as much as 15 degrees over the five to 10 minutes that lead up to the eclipse. The birds and other animals go silent. The light becomes eerie and morphs into a dusky, muted twilight, and you begin to see stark, misplaced shadows abound. A column of darkness in the sky hurtles toward you at over 1,000 miles per hour as the moon’s shadow falls neatly over the sun, turning day into temporary night — nothing like the calming sunset we take for granted every day. Sometimes, a few stars or planets begin to appear faintly in the sky as your eyes get used to the new darkness. The hairs stand up on the back of your neck and the adrenaline kicks in as your brain tries to make sense of what is going on. But it cannot. It has no other point of reference to compare these sensations to. A total eclipse elicits a unique, visceral, primeval feeling that cannot be evoked by a photograph or a video or a newspaper article, and that can be experienced only within the path of totality when the moon completely obscures the disk of the sun. And then of course there is the crowning glory: the sun’s corona, the pearly white outer atmosphere of our nearest star that we can otherwise see only using a fleet of dedicated solar-observing spacecraft. It has an ethereal beauty that is challenging to articulate. For those brief few moments when the corona appears bright in the sky, all the effort made to experience the totality becomes worth it. You want to soak up every second of it and process every feeling, because it is over all too soon. Once the moon’s shadow has passed you feel both exhilarated and deflated because the next opportunity to experience this sensation again could be years away and on the other side of the world. And it is something that you will crave. There is also, of course, the professional motivation for me to gaze upon the subject of my research with my own eyes. Most other astrophysicists only get to look at exploding stars or distant comets through gargantuan telescopes, where they appear as mere pixels on a computer screen or a squiggle on a graph. It’s easy to get detached from the beauty of astronomy when your job becomes more focused on securing grant funding, teaching, administrative duties and bureaucracy. Eclipse chasing reminds me why I chose this field of work in the first place and reignites my passion — and I want to inspire my students with that same passion. Each eclipse is different. The shape and structure of the solar corona varies over the course of each solar cycle. The longer the duration of the eclipse, the darker one’s surroundings are likely to seem. And sandwiched between the sun’s “surface” and the corona is the crimson red chromosphere, the layer of the sun’s atmosphere that I have been researching for almost 20 years to understand its relationship to solar flares. In Australia the briefness of totality meant that this region was exceptionally bright and distinguished, and one could even spot some solar prominences (clouds of hydrogen gas suspended above the chromosphere) with the naked eye. That may also be the case on Monday. People mistakenly think that a partial eclipse is good enough. It is not. When outside the path of totality, the visibility of even 1 percent of the sun’s disk is enough to outshine the entire corona. The buzz around this year’s eclipse through North America has reached a fever pitch not seen since the “Great American Eclipse” of 2017. The duration of totality will be almost twice as long — almost four and a half minutes. (Whether the weather will cooperate is  .) This is far from the first time I’ve tried to cajole people into experiencing the totality in full. In 2017, I persuaded several of my friends in the United States to join me in Nebraska to enjoy the spectacle without forcing them to traipse halfway across the globe. They later told me that they at first thought I may have been somewhat exaggerating the experience because of my professional bias, but when the eclipse was over, I knew that they finally got it. Their faces were overcome with emotion and they struggled to articulate how they were feeling. Because it wasn’t just about what they had seen — it was about what they had experienced.

Advertisement Supported by Guest Essay Dr. Milligan is a senior lecturer in astrophysics at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Almost one year ago, in the middle of the night, I drove from my hometown, Belfast, Northern Ireland, to Dublin to catch an early morning flight to Munich. From there I caught another plane to Bangkok, another to Singapore and yet another to Perth in Western Australia. There, I rented a camper van and began a drive of more than 750 miles north to the town of Exmouth on a remote peninsula on the northwest coast of the continent. This was the only reasonably accessible location on the planet with decent weather prospects from which to view the total solar eclipse on April 20, 2023. The entire event lasted 62 seconds. It was the 10th total solar eclipse I’d traveled to witness. Even as a professional solar physicist, I find it difficult to convey why eclipse chasers like me go to such extraordinary lengths to witness such a fleeting phenomenon, again and again. I was extra determined to make the pilgrimage last year after I was thwarted by clouds in Chile in December 2020, and I couldn’t afford the eye-watering cost of traveling to Antarctica in 2021. I needed to whet my appetite before embarking on another expedition to see the totality of the April 8 eclipse in Mazatlán, Mexico. It may sound absurd, but there is no other celestial event that anyone I know would devote so much time and effort to seeing. If you wish to see the northern lights, you can hop on a plane to Iceland or Norway and have a fairly decent chance of seeing them in the winter months. If you are on the nightside of the planet during a lunar eclipse and the skies are clear, you just need to go outside and look up to see it happening. But unless you are fortunate enough to live within or close to the path of totality, witnessing a total solar eclipse will probably require meticulous planning and marshaling time and money to get you to an optimal location and a bit of luck to make sure the weather forecasts you’ve pored over hold true. Believe me, it is worth the effort. A total solar eclipse is not something that you see — it’s something that you experience. You can feel the temperature around you begin to drop by as much as 15 degrees over the five to 10 minutes that lead up to the eclipse. The birds and other animals go silent. The light becomes eerie and morphs into a dusky, muted twilight, and you begin to see stark, misplaced shadows abound. A column of darkness in the sky hurtles toward you at over 1,000 miles per hour as the moon’s shadow falls neatly over the sun, turning day into temporary night — nothing like the calming sunset we take for granted every day. Sometimes, a few stars or planets begin to appear faintly in the sky as your eyes get used to the new darkness. The hairs stand up on the back of your neck and the adrenaline kicks in as your brain tries to make sense of what is going on. But it cannot. It has no other point of reference to compare these sensations to. A total eclipse elicits a unique, visceral, primeval feeling that cannot be evoked by a photograph or a video or a newspaper article, and that can be experienced only within the path of totality when the moon completely obscures the disk of the sun. And then of course there is the crowning glory: the sun’s corona, the pearly white outer atmosphere of our nearest star that we can otherwise see only using a fleet of dedicated solar-observing spacecraft.

Our Mom Is 75. We’re Moving Heaven and Earth for This Eclipse.,"Advertisement Supported by Guest Essay  and  Ms. Lenihan is a former high school history teacher and an elected member of the School Committee in Lexington, Mass. Ms. Rust is a senior manager for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. If all goes according to plan, on Monday, our 75-year-old mother, Nancy, will be settled into a lawn chair in Waco, Texas — some 1,300 miles from her recliner in Las Vegas — and joining a great many other Americans as they put on solar eclipse glasses, tilt their heads up and try to make sense of what’s happening in the heavens. None of this was a given. Fiercely independent and more than a little skeptical of hype, fads and feverish mass events, our mother is not what you’d call a joiner. Like many of her generation, she has seen a lot in life; she knows what it’s like to have high expectations and be let down. But she also knows the coming eclipse is neither trend nor fad. Planning to see it has united our family in a desire to participate in a mass event that is a wonder of the world. Part of the drive to take our mother to Waco is the hard truth of time. Partial eclipses come and go, but the next awe-inspiring and captivating total eclipse will not be seen again in the contiguous United States until 2044. Our mother is in variable health and disabled. Absent good luck and medical advancements, odds are heavily stacked against her living to see another one. Retirement for our mom came with familiar features — more time for her hobbies, rooting for her favorite teams and vacations that cater to disabled individuals. But this planned excursion is different. A cruise can bill itself as a “once-in-a-lifetime adventure” and then offer many dates on the calendar for the same adventure. No matter how many exhilarating experiences a person has collected in 75 years, this one will stand apart. Her body may be broken, but our mother is still the experience-seeker she has always been. She left home at 18 for a college a thousand miles away, traveled alone to the Middle East and never met a boat, big or small, she didn’t love. These days, our mom can barely walk. She moves around via a scooter. Her back is so damaged from osteoporosis and an unsuccessful surgery that she cannot sleep, stand or sit without pain. Still, she remains the same stubborn and determined person she has always been. Years ago, this meant going to law school at the age of 40, traveling the world as a divorced single woman and starting her own business just shy of her 50th birthday. Now it means bristling when we mentioned that we are coming from our homes in Massachusetts and California to “take” her to see the eclipse. “I decided I was going, so I am going,” she told us. “Compliant” and “rule-following” are words not generally used to describe our mom. It wasn’t true when she was a girl at Catholic school, and it certainly isn’t true now with her adult children. As for us, we don’t always feel like dutiful children. Sure, we send flowers for Mother’s Day and her birthday. We try to speak at least weekly with our mother, but we also frequently end up in yelling matches over politics. In those moments, we tell her she has lost her mind, and she wonders aloud where she went wrong in raising us. Although we visit every Thanksgiving and Christmas, we have never vacationed together as adults. The daily demands of work and our own children long ago got in the way, and those yelling matches are wearying. It’s easy to end a phone call. It’s much harder to stop an uncomfortable conversation at the dinner table. Despite all that, we have spent more than a year making the arrangements to escort her to this phenomenon of nature. Flights, rental cars and a wheelchair-friendly rental house have been booked since last spring. Most important, we identified an eclipse event at Baylor University in Waco that could handle my mom’s needs while giving us the best chance to view the eclipse under clear skies. We asked the organizers so many questions about walkways, bathrooms, seating and parking that a representative replied via email, “I can see you are putting a lot of thought into making this happen for your mom.” It is a lot of planning, but then my mom (and dad) did the same for four children. Our childhood was filled with trips to see the birthplaces of presidents, Thomas Edison’s workshop, Civil War battlefields, the U.S. Mint and more. Now, like many people in their 40s and 50s, we’ve reversed our roles. Our mother stayed home when two of her children viewed the solar eclipse in 2017 in Jackson Hole, Wyo. They came back with tales of an event so transformational, she knew she wanted to witness the next one for herself. People who have never seen a total eclipse are often befuddled by all the hoopla. They most likely recall a partial solar eclipse from childhood — a vague memory of seeing a strange, shadowy impression of the sun through cheap paper sunglasses. But a total solar eclipse is a singularly spectacular phenomenon. The sky darkens, the temperatures drop, and birds fall silent. Viewers can stare directly in the direction of the sun without any eye protection for the minutes of “totality,” when the moon completely covers the sun. Indeed, the only time a human being can see the entire daytime sky is during a total solar eclipse. As Dr. David Grinspoon, now senior scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, explained to a reporter in 2017, “It’s like the veil comes off the heavens for a minute.” A total eclipse is so outside the realm of normal human experience that in the minutes of totality in 2017, we shouted out in delight and spontaneously hugged each other. Many of us that day had not fully understood that the universe could put on such a wondrous display. Knowing all that, our mother is saving her strength. She booked a business class flight to Texas to ease her pain, and she is sitting out most of Waco’s pre-eclipse weekend festivities. She will skip the planned science talks. Instead, she will rest for most of the morning and plan to arrive on Baylor’s campus just in time to see the start of the eclipse. We inherited the desire to explore our world from our mother. The need to care for her now is just as deeply woven into our psyche. Over the past year of planning, the eclipse became less about science for us and more about ensuring that our mother finally has this experience of a lifetime.

Regulating Opioid Prescriptions,"Advertisement Supported by letters Pain management is an inexact science; there is plenty of blame to go around for the abuse of such drugs. Re “ ,” by Shravani Durbhakula (Opinion guest essay, March 25): The chilling effect on the legitimate prescribing and dispensing of opioid medications provoked by the Drug Enforcement Administration’s actions is having devastating real-world consequences among people living with chronic pain. Although opioid therapy is not a panacea for pain management, which often necessitates a complex approach, certain patients undoubtedly benefit from these medications for long-term pain relief. People living with severely disabling pain conditions can participate in life’s activities if their opioid therapy is properly managed. The D.EA., serving in a policing capacity, is not helping our country deal appropriately with the concerning drug overdose crisis. Public health evidence could not be clearer: The significant decline in opioid prescribing   with a significant decline in drug overdoses. Cutting the medical supply of opioids is not addressing overdoses and risks the health and lives of people who need access to essential medications. Regulation of health-related activities to protect the public health of Americans must be guided by experts on those topics, not law enforcement agents. Juan M. Hincapie-Castillo Pittsboro, N.C.   Dr. Shravani Durbhakula’s critique of the Drug Enforcement Administration is misguided and unjustified. It is worth noting that the opioid epidemic was started in the mid-1990s by OxyContin, a potent analgesic agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, promoted by Purdue Pharma, and overprescribed by clinicians. Overprescription and overconsumption of opioid analgesics continued rising until 2010, when the D.E.A. began to crack down on “pill mills” run by physicians. Since 1995, hundreds of physicians have been criminally prosecuted for opioid-related offenses, with drug trafficking, fraud, money laundering and manslaughter accounting for the majority of the convictions. On average, Americans consume about 20 times the amount of prescription opioids as the rest of the world. It is no surprise that the opioid epidemic is primarily endemic to the United States. Given that the ongoing opioid epidemic is driven by illicit fentanyl, the D.E.A. has an indispensable role to play in controlling this public health crisis. Guohua Li Montebello, N.Y. Limiting the supply and prescription of opioids for chronic pain is crucial to addressing the opioid epidemic. In fact, there is no lack of supply of opioids for dying patients, in whom such use is appropriate. Opioids are still overused for chronic pain, for which they  , and there is overuse for acute situations, such as  , in which nonopioids are more effective and safer. Many people seeking opioids on the street — now a dangerous market because of adulteration with fentanyl — became addicted after receiving an opioid prescription from a physician or a dentist. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s role in regulating the opioid market should be applauded, not condemned. Adriane Fugh-Berman Gary M. Franklin Dr. Shravani Durbhakula’s guest essay implicitly repeats a mistaken belief that opioids maintain effectiveness for reducing chronic pain when given daily over long periods, if addiction is not present. This false belief was promoted by pharmaceutical companies 25 years ago and led to the opioid crisis that has affected the United States. Actually, there is compelling biological, epidemiological, experimental and clinical evidence that when taken daily, opioids cause neuroadaptations that enhance sensitivity to pain (including with patients who show no addictive behaviors). I have been treating opioid-dependent chronic pain patients for more than three decades. The culture of opioid overtreatment has been difficult to overcome because of a confluence of factors, but since the   from the Centers for Disease Control warned against extended use, opioids are being   and deaths from the legal use of prescription opioids have declined. When physicians try to taper opioids, it often produces resistance from the patient because of physiological and psychological withdrawal discomfort. Thus, physicians are at a loss as to how to treat opioid-dependent chronic pain patients other than maintaining opioids. Good treatments are available, though, and it is quite fulfilling to work with these patients. Jon Streltzer Honolulu As a pain management physician myself for more than 30 years, I believe that Shravani Durbhakula presents what may be charitably deemed a distorted view of the management of pain in this country. Throughout the piece, it is indicated that poor pain management is mainly because of restrictions on prescribing opioids. This conveniently overlooks the fact that much pain, such as neuropathic pain, which includes cancer pain where the tumor either invades or stretches the nerve, responds better to nonopioids. Other conditions, such as diabetic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, are just as poorly managed, and all are better managed with anticonvulsants and certain antidepressants. Perhaps Dr. Durbhakula might have explained this. And as Dr. Durbhakula briefly alludes to at the end of the essay, the main reason that pain is so poorly managed in this country is that most physicians receive little education in pain management in medical school and postgraduate training programs. A more useful piece would be entitled “Medical Schools Need to Get Into Pain Management.” Steven A. King Philadelphia Dr. Shravani Durbhakula’s essay mirrors my own experience. I am horrified that my primary care physician of many years dismissed my pleas for pain medication for sciatica, an excruciating and common nerve disorder. Instead of prescribing an opiate, my doctor gave me an anti-inflammatory that did little to reduce the bolts of electricity shooting from my hip to my toes, which make walking and sleeping impossible. It wasn’t until six weeks after the onset of sciatica, when I threatened to use street drugs, that my doctor came through with a prescription for five milligrams of oxycodone every six hours, which did not relieve the pain. As a result, I am seeing a pain management specialist. The American Medical Association and the D.E.A. seem to be in lock step in denying adequate pain medication to patients with genuine chronic pain, while veterinarians have no problem providing pain relief to animals. How, as a society, have we gotten so far off-track, punishing patients for the abuse of addicts? If such a law were applied to driver’s licenses, we would take cars away from safe drivers to keep bad drivers off the road. Stacia Friedman Philadelphia The guest essay about the role of the Drug Enforcement Administration uses the word “overdose” in relation to incidents where individuals suffer serious and sometimes fatal effects from using opioids. Overdose suggests that the person either knowingly or accidentally took an excessive amount of a medication with known potency. In the current epidemic of incidents involving street drugs, the correct term is “poisoning,” since the drugs have typically been adulterated with either very potent synthetic opiates or with a variety of other drugs. The user, being unaware of the actual potency of what is being used or what adulterants have been added, can be seriously affected even when taking his or her usual dose. Calling these incidents overdoses is a way of blaming the victims, while calling them “poisonings” opens several avenues to reduce harm, such as making tests for opiate potency readily available to users, or making medical-grade opioids accessible as a viable alternative to street drugs. I encourage your writers, editors and contributors to use poisonings rather than overdoses unless it is clear that the episode being described involved a genuine, correctly labeled, prescription opioid medication.

The Birth Dearth and the Smartphone Age,"Advertisement Subscriber-only  Newsletter Opinion Columnist My newsroom colleagues Jason Horowitz and Gaia Pianigiani have   this week about family-friendly policies in the Italian province of Alto Adige-South Tyrol, which has the highest birthrate of any region in an aging, depopulating Italy. Their story is a portrait not just of a particular policy matrix but also the culture that policy can help foster. In particular, it highlights the extent to which the province offers not just direct funding for parents — for the family with six kids profiled in the story, that means 200 euros a month for each child until they turn 3, on top of the family benefits offered by Italy’s national government — but also a more comprehensive attempt to build a child-friendly social order. The province’s parents “enjoy discounted nursery schools, baby products, groceries, health care, energy bills, transportation, after-school activities and summer camps.” Teachers are encouraged “to turn their apartments into small nurseries,” workplaces offer breastfeeding breaks, and one workplace lobby is filled with “fliers advertising ‘Welcome Baby’ backpacks loaded with tips for new parents and picture books.” As a portrait of a family-friendly exception to a larger   rule, the story dovetails with arguments in a new book from Tim Carney of The Washington Examiner, “ : How Our Culture Made Raising Kids Much Harder Than It Needs to Be,” which focuses on the ways that American society conspires to make parenting seem incredibly high-effort, well-nigh impossible. Some of what Carney describes is a set of habits that’s beyond the reach of policy. (I don’t think there’s much the government can do to persuade parents to “Have Lower Ambitions for Your Kids,” to select one of his more striking chapter titles.) But some of the sense of overwhelmingness that comes with modern parenting seems like it could be mitigated, not just through a once-a-year benefit or tax credit, but also through small consistent signals of support: the family discount on groceries, the convenient in-home child care option, the open play space, the flexible work space. If the developed world isn’t going to disappear into a gray and underpopulated future, there needs to be some “change in the overall ethos and structure of parenting,” as my Opinion colleague Jessica Grose   last year, some rewiring of both parental and societal expectations — a rewiring that one Italian province, in my colleagues’ account, seems to have partly achieved. But emphasize that “partly.” Last week, The Financial Times’s data maven, John Burn-Murdoch, ran a   under the headline “Why family-friendly policies don’t boost birthrates.” That claim seems to conflict with the lessons of Alto Adige-South Tyrol, but really what Burn-Murdoch   wasn’t that such policies have no effect at all. It’s just that they don’t seem to boost birthrates   to make up for whatever social and cultural and economic forces keep pushing them below replacement and then even lower still. And that’s what you see in the Italian example. My colleagues mention that attempts at family-friendly policymaking in the neighboring province of Trentino, which borders Alto Adige-South Tyrol to the south, have been more disappointing: “Its birthrate has nevertheless plunged to 1.36 children per woman,” which is “much closer to the dismal national average.” This is true, but it’s also true that a birthrate of 1.36 is higher than in   in Italy. So Trentino’s efforts are a failure in the sense that they haven’t matched their neighbor’s more impressive results or prevented stark decline. But maybe they’re also a success relative to the no-policy alternative, a case study in how family-friendly efforts make an important difference at the margin even if they can’t simply overcome larger trends. What might actually overcome those trends? The harsh answer for the moment appears to be, well, nothing. But a more optimistic answer would reach for some larger idea of meaning and mission as the thing that low-birthrate cultures need to somehow recover. Part of the explanation for the special fecundity of Alto Adige-South Tyrol, my colleagues suggest, lies in its particular heritage as a Germanic enclave absorbed into the Italian republic, which may instill a special interest in its own cultural survival. Likewise, Carney’s book discusses the   to the general rule of rich societies having below-replacement birthrates — an exception that includes secular Israelis as well as the ultra-Orthodox and clearly has something to do with a sense of national mission that the Israeli experiment retains. And another new book, “ : The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth,” from Catherine Ruth Pakaluk at the Catholic University of America, looks at a different exceptional group, American women having five or more kids, and finds a similar sense of mission, usually religious, as their defining commonality. (I should note that I’ll be moderating   with Pakaluk and Carney at Catholic University in Washington on the evening of April 29.) How you would translate this sense of mission from the smaller to the larger scale, from small regions and countries and particularly religious cohorts to mass societies, is a question whose lack of obvious answers leads us back to pessimism. At the very least it’s clear that any sweeping kind of fertility recovery would have to defy current expectations and integrate structures of meaning, habits of family formation and modern lifestyles in a way that nobody can quite see coming yet. One of the   of Carney’s book, from Leah Libresco Sargeant in First Things, pairs it with Jonathan Haidt’s “ : How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” about the effect of phones and screens and social media on childhood and adolescence. Carney’s book has a discussion of the screen world’s negative effects on family life, and Haidt’s book offers a portrait of what’s gone wrong with Western childhood in the smartphone age, the loss of independence and unscheduled play and face-to-face interactions between kids, that would be fully at home in “Family Unfriendly.” Uniting these accounts, Sargeant makes the point that screens have arguably become a substitute for better forms of family friendliness, a way of managing kids in a society that doesn’t want to really deal with all their disruptive energy, their irreducible non-adultness. It’s a new way of making them seen and not heard, or neither seen nor heard: “A child stooped over a phone,” after all, “is quiet, nondisruptive, and doesn’t have to be in public at all.” If screens are possibly making them unhappier, they’re also making them more tractable in a way that substitutes for any larger social transformation that might make them welcome. We talked about Haidt’s book a bit on our Times Opinion  , and there’s much more to say about his argument and the critiques that it has generated. But let’s stay with this question of how screens help manage childhood. All my biases make me agree with the anti-smartphone case, and indeed my strong suspicion is that the culture smartphones create among not just kids but also 20-something adults helps explain the acceleration of the fertility decline in recent years. But because those are my biases, it’s useful to push against them. So consider a different read on Sargeant’s argument: If screens make kids more manageable, shouldn’t they potentially make it easier to have and rear them? Yes, in this timeline, their use is often intertwined with helicopter parenting and obsessive achievement culture, and may feed into anti-child tendencies in the wider social landscape. But just as a bare fact of parental life, an iPad really can make a long family trip or plane ride much more bearable for a beleaguered mom or dad. A family network of phones really can make it easier to juggle the responsibility for multiple kids and all their play dates and activities. There really are times when it’s OK for kids to be seen but not heard and for streaming entertainment to play a crucial role in letting a parent get dinner on the table. Likewise for adults and their screens. My phone distracts me from my kids, it sets a bad example for them, but it also makes it possible for me to be present in all kinds of important ways, even when I have work obligations. Remote work seems to make it easier to have kids and to live in houses and neighborhoods that give them space, to escape the potentially fertility-crushing effects of urban density. The internet makes it easier to encourage eccentric childhood interests, to run a home-schooling cooperative, to connect with grandparents in distant states and more. In our podcast discussion, I was perhaps a bit more optimistic than my co-hosts about our capacity to create a more smartphone-free form of childhood. But I will concede that we are not going to build a smartphone-free  on any non-apocalyptic timeline. So to imagine a transformed culture that’s friendlier to families and more welcoming to kids is necessarily to imagine one that employs screens in all kinds of ways, but with a mastery over their effects and an intentionality about their uses that we have not yet been able to achieve.

(It’s no surprise that people describe a scheduled break from their digital devices as a “Sabbath.”) Finally, religious ritual often requires that we make contact with the sacred in the presence of other people, whether in a church, mosque, synagogue or over a dinner-table prayer.

Three Democratic Senators Are Stuck Indulging an Outdated Fantasy,"Advertisement Supported by Lydia Polgreen Opinion Columnist In 1999, a Florida lawyer, Anuraag Singhal, represented a man convicted of gunning down a police officer. Singhal had to somehow persuade a jury that his client, Jeffrey Lee Weaver, should face life in prison rather than the electric chair, the punishment the hard-charging prosecutor sought. “I hope you can find some love in your heart for Jeff Weaver, and I hope you’ll let him die in prison,” Singhal said, according to a  , the local newspaper. The article described tears rolling down his cheeks and his voice breaking with emotion as he pleaded for Weaver’s life. Singhal won the day. A divided jury recommended life in prison. Singhal was clearly a very talented attorney and a man on the rise. He would become active in conservative legal circles, joining the local chapter of the Federalist Society. In 2019, President Donald Trump appointed him to a federal judgeship in Florida. He was confirmed that December with a bipartisan Senate vote of 76 to 17. Evidently no one raised a peep about his defense of a man who killed a police officer, nor his pivotal role in reducing the man’s sentence despite Republican posturing about protecting law enforcement. Among the Democratic senators who voted to give Singhal this lifetime appointment were three centrists who often burnish their bipartisan bona fides and tough-on-crime credentials: Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, both of Nevada, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. So it is striking that these same three senators have   to announce that they will not support an eminently qualified nominee of their own party’s president after Republican senators and conservative activists smeared him, first accusing him of being an antisemite and, when that effort fizzled in the face of staunch support from mainstream Jewish organizations, of being soft on crime and supporting cop killers. The ostensible reason? The nominee, Adeel Abdullah Mangi, served on an advisory board of an organization that supports the families of people in prison and helps formerly incarcerated people as they try to rebuild their lives. “This organization has sponsored a fellowship in the name of Kathy Boudin, a member of the domestic terrorist organization Weather Underground, and advocated for the release of individuals convicted of killing police officers,” Cortez Masto  . “I cannot support this nominee.” Mangi would make history as the first Muslim American federal appellate judge. Republicans are grasping at straws to block him. Why on earth would Democrats hand them a rope? One glance at the facts reveals that the insinuation that Mangi supported Boudin or the idea of releasing killers of police officers is as baseless as the allegation that he is an antisemite. The organization in question is the  . Mangi did not seek out the group on his own. His corporate law firm, through its pro bono practice, asked him to take on a case that the organization had brought on behalf of a New York inmate who died after being beaten and choked by prison guards. In 2020, Mangi won a $5 million payment to the prisoner’s family, and the state also   throughout the prison as part of the settlement, a huge policy victory that would not only protect inmates but also protect guards from false allegations of misconduct. This is the kind of pro bono work that normally would be a résumé-burnisher for a Democratic judicial nominee whose day-to-day caseload involves litigating on behalf of major corporations. After the big win, the Alliance of Families for Justice asked Mangi to join an advisory panel to evaluate similar cases the organization might take on in the future. Mangi agreed, but according to a letter he sent to Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a copy of which I acquired, the panel has never held a single meeting, and he never handled another case brought by the organization. He had no role in the organization’s governance or operations. Boudin, who served more than 20 years in prison for her role in a deadly robbery in 1981, had ties to the alliance after she was paroled. She long   for her role in the robbery, in which two police officers were killed. She died in 2022, having spent her last years advocating restorative justice and criminal justice reform. There was another,   that the organization was involved in an event calling to release elderly and infirm prisoners, including Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther who was serving a life sentence for killing a police officer. I realize that not everyone is invested in legal defense for people convicted of murdering police officers. But it hardly matters because Mangi had nothing to do with these cases. In his letter to Booker, Mangi said he had never met Boudin and had no involvement with an event associated with Abu-Jamal. Indeed, the notion that his very slight connection to this organization might derail his nomination casts a pall on any attorney who does pro bono work. Mangi wrote in his letter to Booker that he has never defended someone accused of killing a police officer. “I condemn any violence against law enforcement officers without equivocation,” he said. Some   have opposed his nomination, but   have   him. The Leadership Conference, a coalition of mainstream civic, labor and human rights groups that are central to the Democratic Party — think of household names like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the N.A.A.C.P. and the United Steelworkers —   this week in strong support of his confirmation. A former Third Circuit judge appointed by President George H.W. Bush also wrote to Booker in support of Mangi last month, saying “This is a nominee who should — and ordinarily would — have widespread bipartisan support,” he wrote, according to  . “Instead, he is being subjected to attacks against his character.” These allegations are so threadbare that they did not even come up in his confirmation hearing. Republican senators were too busy demanding that Mangi  . They only pivoted when that attempt failed. Democratic senators may wish to appear to have rejected the Islamophobic smears, but it is dismaying that these equally baseless accusations have become a fig leaf for Democrats running for re-election who fear attacks from well-funded far-right judicial activist groups. But in a way it is Joe Manchin, who is not running for re-election and has no excuse other than his fetish for  , who most powerfully illustrates what is most enraging about this whole episode. He is the most extreme illustration of a Democratic tendency to unilaterally disarm in the face of bad faith actions of the Republican Party. It bespeaks a willingness to pretend that an old way of doing politics — the give and take between broadly reasonable, well-meaning people — still exists in American politics. This is a fantasy Democrats indulge at their peril. It is not uncommon for senators to ask questions about a nominee’s political or even religious background and whether that background would color their jurisprudence. Amy Coney Barrett was asked about her   faith in her confirmation hearings for the federal bench in 2017. “If you’re asking whether I take my faith seriously and I’m a faithful Catholic — I am, although I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge,”  . Asked about making paid speeches to a  , she  : “It has never been my practice to investigate all of the policy positions of a group that invites me to speak.” Fair enough. If that is the standard, why wouldn’t it apply to a nominee like Mangi as well? Which brings us back to Anuraag Singhal. He spent much of his career as a criminal defense lawyer, representing people accused of a wide range of violent and nonviolent crimes. Singhal’s work defending a man who killed a police officer was honorable and ethical. He was fulfilling his crucial role in our justice system. I wish every death penalty defendant had such skilled counsel. From the available evidence, he appears to have a sterling legal record and has so far proved to be a fair-minded judge on the federal bench. Democrats were right to vote for his confirmation, exactly as the Constitution envisioned the Senate’s role to advise and consent to a president’s judicial nominees. On this very same principle they should dismiss these baseless smears and vote to confirm Adeel Mangi without delay.

"Joe Lieberman and David Mixner, Exemplary Outsiders","Advertisement Supported by Guest Essay Mr. Kirchick is the author of “Secret City: The Hidden History of Gay Washington” and a contributing writer at Tablet. The gay activist David Mixner and Senator Joe Lieberman died last month at the ages of 77 and 82, respectively, and were it not for the coincident timing of their passing, I would have no reason to reflect collectively upon their legacies. Biographically, ideologically and temperamentally, they were very different men, and to my knowledge, never interacted. But I was fortunate to know them both, and after attending their funerals last week, I’ve come to appreciate some important qualities they shared. In the summer of 1993, Mr. Mixner was at the height of his political influence. An old friend, Bill Clinton, was occupying the White House. In April, Mr. Mixner spoke to an estimated one million people assembled on the National Mall for the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi-Equal Rights and Liberation. And the next month, he featured prominently in a Vanity Fair spread celebrating America’s “new gay power elite.” As would become evident once Mr. Clinton reneged on a promise to repeal the ban on gay people serving in the armed forces, however, the trappings of power were not what attracted Mr. Mixner to politics. Even before Mr. Clinton entered the White House, military leaders had expressed strong support for the ban, and the administration eventually agreed to a compromise allowing gays to serve provided they kept their sexual orientation secret, a policy known as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Mr. Mixner did not limit his displeasure with Mr. Clinton to words, leading a protest at the White House in which he was arrested along with 28 other people. “I just have to do what is right,”  . Though he would later reconcile with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Mixner paid a heavy cost for his fidelity to principle. “In 24 hours, every one of my clients canceled,” he told me in 2019 of the business consultancy he operated alongside his political activities. To pay his rent, Mr. Mixner pawned old watches. In 2006, Senator Lieberman faced a similar conundrum. Only six years earlier, he had made history as the first Jew to appear on a major party presidential ticket when Vice President Al Gore chose him as his running mate. But Mr. Lieberman’s refusal to join other Democrats in condemning the Iraq war, which most of his Senate colleagues had initially supported, infuriated the party’s left-wing base, fueling a primary challenge to his re-election bid by the antiwar scion of a prominent family, Ned Lamont. Had Mr. Lieberman joined the rest of his colleagues in washing his hands of Iraq, he might have staved off Mr. Lamont’s campaign and handily won re-election. But to do so would have been out of character for Mr. Lieberman, who believed strongly in the justice of the war and securing a democratic future for the Iraqi people. Though Mr. Lieberman lost the nomination to Mr. Lamont, he refused to let the Democratic primary electorate have the final say. He mounted an independent candidacy in the general election and became the first and only senator in American history to lose a party primary and regain his seat in the same cycle.  a pacifist who got his political start in the movement against the Vietnam War, and Mr. Lieberman personified the liberal hawk, both men were inspired by the two forces that most captured the imaginations of young people in the 1960s: John F. Kennedy and the civil rights movement. The 35th president’s appeal that Americans “ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country,” and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s insistence that that country live up to its founding principles, motivated Mr. Mixner and Mr. Lieberman to pursue lives devoted to public service. Theirs would be careers guided by idealism. Mr. Mixner and Mr. Lieberman were also members of minority groups that, in different ways and to varying degrees, had been excluded from the promise of equal American citizenship. This experience of being outsiders deeply affected their political worldviews and caused them to embrace the struggles of other excluded Americans as their own. Mr. Lieberman was a longtime supporter of gay rights, sponsoring the legislation that ultimately rescinded “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Allowing gay people to serve openly in the military, Mr. Lieberman   at the time, was “an extension, the next step of the civil rights movement.” Meanwhile, in  , posted in late October, Mr. Mixner spoke emotionally about the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, declaring, “We will never allow the kind of pogroms that haunted the people of Jewish faith in Russia and Eastern Europe again.” Mr. Mixner and Mr. Lieberman lived their lives openly and proudly — one as a gay man, the other as an observant Jew — serving as role models for their communities, and indeed for all Americans. Though their independence of mind could sometimes lead to charges of stubbornness, Mr. Mixner and Mr. Lieberman were adept at working across political divides. In 1978, Mr. Mixner   Ronald Reagan to publicly oppose a California ballot initiative that would have banned gay people from teaching in public schools, an intervention that proved decisive in defeating the measure at the ballot box. When Mr. Clinton later   the Defense of Marriage Act, the law he had signed as president in 1996 that forbade the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, many gay activists responded with self-righteous anger, given that he had signed the law as president. Mr. Mixner counseled forgiveness. “The purpose of a movement is to change minds, not in some Stalinistic way to punish those who are not ideologically pure,” he said. And in a final act of grace, before he died, Mr. Lieberman asked Mr. Lamont, who since their bruising Senate campaign became governor of Connecticut, to deliver the first eulogy at his funeral. In his own eulogy to Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Gore used the Yiddish word mensch to describe his former running mate, explaining: “Those who seek its definition will not find it in dictionaries so much as they find it in the way Joe Lieberman lived his life. Friendship over anger. Reconciliation as a form of grace. We can learn from Joe Lieberman’s life some critical lessons about how we might heal the rancor in our nation today.” And we can learn the same from the life of David Mixner, who though raised in an Irish Catholic family also qualified as a mensch. Sitting in the pews at each of their services, I had the distinct feeling that not just two menschen, but an entire style of politics, was being laid to rest.

Are Smartphones Just a Scapegoat for Our Unhappy Children?,"Advertisement transcript This transcript was created using speech recognition software. While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. I feel like all the trains in Italy. Cancellato! Cancellato! I once got stuck in Pisa when they canceled the trains. Yeah. It was a great opportunity for me to tell my kids about the failures of European social welfare capitalism. Oh. Oh, good. Good. The kids love that. [MUSIC PLAYING] From New York Times Opinion, I’m Ross Douthat. I’m Michelle Cottle. I’m Carlos Lozada. And I’m Lydia Polgreen. And this is “Matter of Opinion.” Woo-hoo! We’re — [LAUGHTER] no, we’re reunited. We’re all recording — And it feels so good. (SINGING) Reunited — — in the same room together. I could almost touch all of my co-hosts. Please don’t. And then Carlos would call H.R. But I will not because we’re talking about disconnection, virtual alienation. We’re going to talk about kids and smartphones. Dun, dun, dun. So there is a lot of evidence that kids — American kids, maybe kids around the developed world — are not doing so well over the last 10 years. Not just in a sort of kids being kids way, but there is a real shift in rates of depression, anxiety, mental illness diagnoses, suicide and suicidality. All of these things are up for young people, and so are hours spent on smartphones. And there’s a widely circulated theory, seemingly plausible, but also hotly contested, that screens and social media are responsible for making teenagers, especially, unusually unhappy. So this is a big problem since screens and smartphones are sort of the defining technologies of our age. And I’m hoping we can resolve this problem here today in a podcast. [LAUGHTER] Maybe not. But maybe we can debate some solutions, responses, and talk about what might be going too far in our desire to protect kids. So let’s get started with a personal question. For those of you, us, who have kids or teenagers, in the house or out of the house, what are the rules for smartphones in your home? So I’ve got the oldest, I think. Mine are 20 and 18. So right now there are no rules. It’s obviously a free for all. But when they were — It’s a vicious landscape. It’s “Lord of the Flies” at Michelle’s house. The only contact I get is when somebody wants to text me for money. But — That was me, so I’m sorry about that, but — Dang, Ross! So going back, though, I think we hit the smartphone button when they were in seventh grade because that’s when they went to middle school, and that’s kind of just — that was the standard around here. And then we tried to set limits on screen times and things like that. And I have to say the pandemic made that infinitely more complicated. Carlos. So first rule of parenting is you don’t talk about parenting. [LAUGHTER] No, the first rule of parenting is that each kid is different, right? So I have three kids. One kind of mid-teens, one early teens, and one is finishing up elementary school. My oldest, who is 16, has a smartphone. He only got it last year. And he uses it mainly to be in touch with us, with his editor at the student paper, with his friends. My daughter who’s 13 has one of those little mini old-fashioned iPods which she uses to communicate with text and email with friends, with her dance group or her orchestra friends, and to listen to books. And my youngest, who’s 10, wants an Apple Watch, but isn’t getting it. [MICHELLE LAUGHS] They don’t use any kind of social media. We don’t ban it, but we discourage it. And part of the trick is that they really don’t have a lot of free time between theater, or dance, or baseball, or student journalism. They don’t have a lot of time to go on social media. We’re keeping our fingers crossed that it stays that way, at least until they reach the age of reason, the age of reasonableness. [LAUGHS] We’re still waiting on that at my house. Forty, 41. But that is — Good luck with that. — the way it works so far in our home. Huh, that’s interesting. I mean, I don’t have kids, as you all know. But I’ve tried to imagine what rules and limits would I want to set. And I think in some ways, Carlos, what you’re describing, it sounds like both an ideal but also very tough. Because in order to make sure that your kids have really, really full lives, it probably requires a lot of engagement from you and your wife. And living in the modern world — Little sleep, yes. [LAUGHTER] — we’re all very, very busy. And — Yes. And think about the way that I grew up — and we’re all Gen X — and I had perhaps an extreme version of the free range childhood. Even though my mother was technically a stay-at-home mom, she did not want to see us home all day. And we sort of ran wild. It’s hard for me to imagine wanting anything different for my own children. But I realize that’s not the world that we live in. But Ross, you have the youngest kids of all of us. So you’re just staring this down, and you have a bunch of them. So — We — well, yeah, and the oldest is 13, and she still does not have a phone of any kind. And my assumption is that we will crack and get her some kind of what my kids call a dumb phone next year for eighth grade. She is trying to negotiate with me to get a smarter phone, insisting that she would never use social media. She will probably invoke the idea that she’s so busy, the excuse — The lie my feeds are feeding me? The lie your kids are feeding you. But it is very unlikely that we would crack on that. But we really haven’t entered fully into this world. But I want to pick up on Lydia’s comment about the free range childhood, because one of the reasons we’re talking about this this week is that this debate has been running for a while, but it’s resurfaced because of a new book by Jonathan Haidt called “The Anxious Generation,” that’s basically Haidt making the case not just that there’s something specific about, let’s say, the social life of teenage girls on Instagram or TikTok or the social life of teenage boys playing video games, that’s a problem for mental health, but also that this is a substitute for exactly the kind of childhood you’re describing. So it’s not just the screens themselves are the devil. It’s also that the screens themselves have reshaped social life and eliminated certain features of childhood that taught people how to be adults, taught people how to navigate interpersonal dynamics in person, how to communicate with the opposite sex, how to settle fights on the playground with their friends, this kind of thing. Haidt has a number of critics who basically say he’s making a correlation/causation mistake. That, yes, it happens to be that mental health has gotten worse over the smartphone era, but that does not prove that the phones are the problem. Do you guys buy the argument? I mean, I’ve read the competing correlation/causation arguments, and, of course, have looked in detail at every single study and weighed them — I have been personally running regression analyses in my spare time. I was going to say, I have so many histograms, you would not believe it. [LAUGHTER] You would not believe the number of histograms. But to me, the bigger question is one of emphasis. Should we be more concerned by the vacuum that was created by putting children into a much more protective bubble? Is the problem that we need to solve the transformation of childhood into what many kids experience as much more tightly controlled and scheduled and mediated through parents as opposed to mediated through your friend groups and learning how to build your own boundaries and relationships and things like that, or do we tackle the problem at the level of smartphones? Look, I personally believe that I have a dysfunctional relationship with smartphones. And so it’s very easy for me to look at kids and be like, oh, yeah, of course they must also have a very dysfunctional relationship. But honestly, I don’t know. I think it’s always a problem to put too much emphasis on any one particular culprit, and it is generally our impulse to blame technology. I mean, TV — did TV ruin kids? Probably. But that is — I mean, look at us. — one of the panics that we had. And then for years everyone told us that violent video games absolutely positively were turning our children into sociopaths. This, on one level, is what we do. We decide it’s something that we can tackle simply or blame simply. But then there’s 30 questions I have as to what we’re really worried about here. I mean, are we upset about kids sitting around on their phones rather than playing outside, worried about them doing less in-person socializing, worried about them becoming addicted to external affirmation from their online groups, upset about them having access to scary news and inappropriate information, upset that they’re not as independent, worried about bullying? I mean, there’s so many things that fall into this category that we’ve just decided are all about smartphones. So I think the virtue of the Haidt argument, it’s a technology is doing something bad argument that has a pretty narrow and focused zone of concern. And that zone of concern is the fact that young people report being unhappier as young people than was the case generally in our cohort and preceding generations. And this pretty clearly tracks to a kind of point of divergence. I think 2012 to 2014 is sort of a break point in the data. If you just look at the charts that Haidt puts together, you say, well, yeah, something clearly happened in this window that is not just teenagers or teenagers. You need some explanation. And that’s why his critics have tended to also put forward contingent time bound speculations. Like it’s the aftermath of the financial crisis, it’s the rise of school shootings and school shooting drills. There is, I think, a quest for a particular kind of explanation because you have this divergence in the data. Now, there is also the response or argument that what we’re seeing here is just better diagnosis. That kids have had these mental health problems all the time, and, for better or worse — many people would say for better, some people would say for worse — we’re talking more about mental health. Maybe that’s the whole divergence. We’ve become more open to these discussions or more likely to offer these diagnoses, and that alone is enough to — We’re a therapeutic society. Right. We’re a therapeutic society and it’s finally achieved takeoff, and that’s where we are now. I try to be skeptical of the Haidt thesis because it confirms my priors. Like Lydia, I have a toxic relationship to my smartphone. I don’t use that much social media. But the social media I use I’m addicted to and make the excuse that it’s part of my job. So I have a natural inclination to buy into the argument. So I try and be more skeptical of it. But I think that right now it’s a pretty parsimonious explanation for at least some of this divergence. You’re saying parsimonious in a positive sense? Right. In a positive — in a positive sense, yeah. Because the data are quite dramatic. I mean, I was looking for other sources of information about this because Haidt, in his book, talks about, actually, this data is global. These are things that we’re seeing in other countries. So I was looking at other alternative sources of data on this. And there was a UNICEF report that was published in 2020. And it’s really interesting actually how much of an outlier the U.S is. And this is a place where I actually have a significant amount of skepticism about the Haidt book. It counted 38 of the wealthiest countries in the world, and the United States was 32nd in terms of mental well-being on this list. And the top five were not what you would expect. They were the Netherlands, Cyprus, Spain, Romania and Denmark. So this is just — I mean, I would have predicted Romania. Yeah, absolutely. But maybe not the rest. Absolutely. The reports in this study on the effect of technology use was one quarter the size of the effect from bullying, for example. So I came to this information saying, like, oh, yeah, this all sounds plausible. But the more I dug into other sources and other cuts at looking at this question of child happiness, the more skepticism that I had that this one explanation was enough. I think you need to take the changes of childhood and technology together. Haidt does push back against the critics who say it is a monocausal explanation by saying that, look, I’m talking about the changes to the independent childhood that we had in the ‘70s or the ‘80s versus today. And I accept that defense of his. But in some ways, if you look at just his body of work, even just his “Atlantic” articles over the years, he does feel like he’s beating the same drum over and over again with slightly different speeds. I read each piece individually and I feel persuaded. I read them together and I feel suspicious, right? I don’t mean suspicious in an ill intent on the part of the writer kind of way. But I think of a worldview that maybe explains too much. And I also wonder if different kids are different. So when I was a kid, my mother was obsessed — obsessed with us not watching too much television because she thought it was going to rot our brains. She would come home and she would put her hand on the top of the TV set. And if it was warm, she’d know — [LAUGHTER] — that we’d broken the rules. And my mother did not mess around. She’d unplugged the TV. She’d get out a pair of scissors and she’d snip off the plug. Oh my god! As a punishment, so that we would not watch it again. Totally, totally badass. We were — That’s real parenting. But I want to tell you — I want to tell you, it’s even better parenting. You know what my brothers and I did? We would go to RadioShack and we would buy a plug, and then we taught ourselves how to reattach a plug and then not make it look like — Yeah, but this is exactly — You have skills. This is the bypass of childhood. Kids are going to bypass any form of control over — But Haidt would say that is the kind of childhood creativity that is being lost, the ability to do end-arounds when your parents — To McGuyver your TV set! Exactly. Ross you mentioned school shootings. I mean, this month, believe it or not, will mark 25 years since Columbine. And the kids that Haidt is talking about are kids that have grown up entirely in a world formed by that experience. I don’t just mean Columbine, but I mean the experience of lockdown drills in schools, knowing that every day they’re going to a place where they’re meant to be taught and educated and protected, but that they feel at risk. The reason my son has a smartphone is because there were bomb threats at his school, which he covered as a student journalist. But that’s why he has a smartphone to begin with. I find that argument totally unpersuasive to explain the divergence that you see — Oh, no, no, I meant — — starting in the early 2010s. No, I’m not saying — I’m not saying — It doesn’t track, particularly, with the rise of school shootings. It doesn’t track at all with general violence in schools, which was much higher in the 1980s and early 1990s than today. And it does, allowing Lydia’s point that the data is complex, it does show up — the teenage mental health issue — in lots of other countries that don’t have active shooter drills and so on. What’s odd in this debate is that Haidt is making an argument that in a way tracks pretty well with a lot of traditional left wing preoccupations. He’s saying a bunch of big rapacious capitalist entities, in order to make a profit, are exploiting your children and destroying their mental health. And a lot of people on the left are like, no, that’s not satisfying enough. It has to be something that Republicans did, right? Because Silicon Valley isn’t coded as Republican. It has to be climate change because we can blame Republicans for that. It has to be school shootings because we can blame Michelle’s Southern relatives and their guns for that. That feels very sensitive. But — I don’t know. It’s like you’re just looking for — I mean, there are many reasons why children can be anxious all at once. I worry a little bit about Haidt pointing to smartphones as the overwhelming reason. There are multiple reasons why any one kid can be having trouble. And another — and this is where I was headed. I wasn’t saying that therefore the explanation is school shootings. In the panoply of possible reasons for kids to be struggling, another is — Lydia and Ross have mentioned that you have your own toxic addictive relationships with your phones. I mean, these are also kids who have grown up with parents — With parents, yes. — who are entirely tethered to their devices and who basically — a few years ago, I read this book by Sherry Turkle called “Reclaiming Conversation,” and she had a line that has stuck with me since then where she says that all our relationships now come with the assumption of divided attention. And that is all the more so with children seeing the divided attention that their parents, already distracted and busy and tired parents, give to them. All right, let’s take a break. And when we come back, we’ll talk about whether we should be even looking for solutions here. And if so, what they might be. [MUSIC PLAYING] One of the things that I’m interested in is when you start talking about what to do about it, then it gets really sticky, though. And I think one of the things that does bother me is when the states start looking at, well, how are we going to save our children? They start talking about putting limitations on what kids can do on their phones. And you quickly get into questions of First Amendment rights and things like this. None of which is going to matter if you’ve got kids who are watching their parents sit on their phones all day long 24/7. That’s like lecturing kids not to do drugs while you’re sitting there dropping acid. So there is a question about how we’re going to tackle this. And this just seems to be one of those areas that we rush to because it seems very easy to tackle. We’ve had several states try and limit what kids can do and what their social media account age is. But it’s a lot of constitutional questions, and a lot of time and energy going into something that doesn’t strike me is going to be all that useful. I mean, just on the personal side, Michelle’s first, right, since you’re the senior parent in this conversation, meaning the one with the most experience. Yeah, call me old. The one with the most experience. Walk that one back, Ross. The wisest. Backpedal. Your kids are basically through high school into college, right? Mhm. And if you look back over the last 10 years, setting aside the state, setting aside government, are there things that either you as a parent or you as a consumer of school-based services — are there things that you wish you had done differently or things that you wish your kids’ schools had done differently? So, now, one problem that I do think parents have is once you hit a certain age with kids, you can’t limit their screen time because they’re doing homework online. So I would try to keep limits on my kids’ screen time, and they would just be like, well, we’re just doing math homework on our computer. And unless you are going to stand over that child every minute — and let’s be clear, it wasn’t a question of I didn’t want to put in the time or effort to stand over my child. It’s also, you can’t police your children like that. I mean, you have to give your children a little bit of freedom to screw up or whatever. So it was absolutely impossible on some level. It got even worse during Covid. Yeah. And COVID — It was impossible, where it all got conflated. — completely — my kids’ friends and my kids themselves had real Covid isolation issues. And it became really dark at certain times. And it was really hard to tell whether being able to connect with their friends on their smartphones was helping or hurting or whatever because technology has taken over our lives. I tend to think that as a society when we’ve given up on being reasonable about something, we then try to put limits just on the kids. I asked my daughter, who’s 13 — I told her that we were going to have this conversation, and I asked her what she thought about rules and limits and bans. And she said she didn’t have a problem with there being rules and limiting access to certain things. She’s like, we do that for lots of other stuff that seems OK. But maybe you all should have some limits, too. She felt that — Yes! Her reaction was that it shouldn’t just be for children. That a lot of bad things happen on social media when adults use social media. Yeah. I don’t how we think we can save our children if that’s the approach that we’re going to take. Well, I guess I’ll speak up for the kids first approach then. I completely agree that obviously the example that you set for your kids makes a huge difference. And I obviously think social media and smartphones have a deranging effect on adults too. But childhood is both a era of greater personal social emotional vulnerability than adulthood and also a period in which we take for granted that it is possible to impose substantial regulations that in a free society we can’t impose on adults. And we do this with lots of things. We do this with driving. There’s lots of terrible drivers on the road, but we don’t say, oh, we can’t let adults drive because we’re showing kids that they’ll be bad drivers when they grow up. Same with alcohol, tobacco products, all of these things. And we can argue back and forth about where the exact line should be. But I do think that social media age requirements, things like banning smartphones from schools and so on, are just obvious first steps, that don’t get you close to fixing all of the problems, but are things that you should just do and see what happens. As you were talking, I was thinking about some of the cultural differences about this. I don’t think there’s any society that’s like, OK, we want to teach our children to have a healthy relationship with tobacco. But when it comes to alcohol, there is a different attitude. Alcohol is seen as an important source of conviviality, of pleasure, of enjoyment, and cultivating one’s temperate enjoyment of it is something that starts relatively early in life. And let’s set social media aside for just one second and just talk about technology and screens in general. We are all going to live in a world where screens are going to be a part of it. And I’m not going to give my baby a bottle filled with watered-down wine, right? But I might give my 13-year-old, a very, very small glass of wine watered down with seltzer at Thanksgiving or whatever. That to me feels more of an approach that I could get behind rather than just ban it. And I think about my own consumption of television. I mean, I told that very funny story about my mom and cutting the cord. The reality is that if there is a television on in a room, I cannot pay attention to anything else. I mean, if there was a television over the other side of your shoulder, Ross, I would be so distracted. Fascinating. Whereas, my wife, who grew up in a household where the TV was on all the time, can just tune it out. It’s just white noise to her. So I guess if we’re going to live in a world with these technologies, how do we prepare kids to have healthy relationships to them, to turn them into tools that can serve them? The problem is if it just takes over your entire life. [LAUGHS] To be the optimist — the cockeyed optimist here, right? Lydia brought up tobacco. The United States had a massive public health campaign against tobacco that, in fact, did lead to dramatic changes in smoking’s social acceptability and all of these things. And there is this range of proposals in Congress. There’s the Kids Online Safety Act, which would require tech platforms to make various design changes. Protect Kids on Social Media Act, which would establish an age minimum and parental consent. And then there’s this general — there’s a lot of grandstanding in Congress about what Meta has done wrong and the different ways these platforms have exploited kids. And to the extent that you find the public psychological health arguments around tech and social media persuasive, is there any law or public health measure that you would like to see pass or imagine would be helpful? Or does it just not seem like a political problem? I’m not convinced it’s a political problem. And I also think a lot about the ways in which such laws could be used. As a queer person, I think about kids who are trying to figure out who they are and what are the places that they might connect with other people like them. Obviously, I grew up in a connection desert growing up in East and West Africa. We didn’t even have a home phone for a while. So I don’t romanticize the disconnected life at all. I think loneliness has lots of different facets to it. And I think that IRL friendships are great. But friendships over distance I think can be very, very meaningful. We have a whole literature of epistolary friendships — Letter writing is another lost art — Another lost art. I mean — — that the smartphone has killed. Yeah. Voice memos on the other hand — [LAUGHTER] so, yeah, I’m skeptical about the role of legislation in this area. I mean, I think, actually, profound social changes are needed. I think that we need to rethink the way that we treat children in society, the amount of freedom, the amount of autonomy that we give them. Obviously I believe that they need to be protected from dangerous things. But — and this is just my bias from my own experience, having been a very, very independent kid — I’m a strong believer in child independence. I think laws sometimes reflect social changes and sometimes anticipate them. And I would be open to a lot of the kind of reforms that Jonathan Haidt suggests, to some degree, of limiting access to social media. I’m persuaded by the potential educational impact of smartphone bans or at least severe reductions in smartphone use in schools. At the same time, I still believe that there is a multiplicity of factors behind the mental health and well-being crisis that we’re seeing with kids in the United States. So I’m both open to them, but skeptical that they would solve the underlying issue that we’re facing. All right, well let’s close out by just looking forward a little bit, because I’m curious where you guys think this debate will be in 10 or 20 years, maybe at the point where some of our children are parenting themselves. Oh, I can’t wait for that. Can’t wait for that. And grandchildren reversing the birth dearth. [LAUGHTER] Anyway — Different podcast, Ross. Different podcast. Different episodes. Save it. But isn’t it all the same episode, Lydia? I’m curious, generally, because there’s also a way in which when technological change happens, sometimes by the time you figure out what’s going wrong in one particular dispensation, we’re headed into a new dispensation, right? So just hearing the way that schools rely on the internet and tech for assignments and so on, does that survive the age of ChatGPT and AI assistants? Is it possible that we’re going to head into a landscape where all of education is going to have to recalibrate itself? They’re never going analog again, Ross. Well, that’s — They’re not going back to analog. It’s too — it’s not going to happen. OK, but so then what is the world on the other side of AI or on the other side of any other looming technological change, on the other side of virtual reality? We don’t know. That’s what’s so great about it. Could you have predicted where we are now 20 years ago? I don’t think you could have. Come on. I mean once that’s true once Elon Musk has put chips in all of our brains, then we’ll experience the singularity and we’ll know what’s happening. All right, let me — No, no, I have a real answer here. Let me — all right, Carlos — but no, let me first say, I am detecting just an incredible level of fatalism from all three of you about technological change. Yes. And I agree with all of you that, yes, of course, we are not undoing the internet revelation — excuse me — Wow. See, Freudian — paging Dr. Freud. We know what you want, Ross. We know what I want. I want the singularity, too. But it seems to me that there’s a huge question here, which is, are we going to master these kind of technologies or be mastered by them? And I feel like, are all of you just content to drift into the Neuralink future? Carlos, the humanist, I appeal to you to close us out with resistance. Come now — Hashtag resistance. — speak for paper, speak for print, speak for analog. I only read on paper. Here I am saying that on a podcast. Who’s read “Canticle for Leibowitz“? Well, you know I have. That’s a — Not me. It’s a book that I highly recommend. It’s a book in which the existential perils of technology are taken so seriously that we attempt to fully simplify our lives to purge ourselves of these technologies. Yet, inevitably we recreate them with the same destructive results. And just because it fails, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t make the attempt. So I think it’s foolish to be optimistic in this world, but it is not foolish to be hopeful. But even as we make those attempts, I’m skeptical of a silver bullet answer to the problem that we’ve discussed today. We will simply move on to a new version of it, which then we will look back with longing on this simpler time. The way that Lydia talked about the television story, we’re going to talk about trying to — you remember back in the 2000s when we tried to regulate smartphones? And we didn’t know that the fill in the blank was coming next and that was going to be even more insidious and destructive. Brain chip. Lydia is right. Brain chip. No, but I think that’s — I think that’s a really good way of putting it, Carlos. And I think that the reality is that things stop being cool. Facebook has been abandoned to the boomers and — Oh, you cannot pay kids to be on Facebook. — other social media. And I think it’s one of those things that’s seen as a punch line. But kids reject the things that their parents are into, and are addicted to, and want to talk about, and want to focus on. And I think that things become not cool. And that’s definitely a thing that I’m seeing among young people that I know, that they’re like, you know what’s not cool is spending all your time on social media. And on that note, I’m going to return home and explain to my 13-year-old daughter that it is her duty to make the smartphone uncool in her middle school and high school. And we’ll leave it there. And when we come back, we’ll get hot and cold. Just tell her how cool you think it is and that’s going to do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, guys, it’s time to get hot cold. Who’s got one this week? I’m hot cold this week. Carlos. So I just returned from “Matter of Opinion”‘s official vacation destination, which is Italy. Italia. And I happened to be there during Holy Week. And so we did Palm Sunday mass and Easter Sunday mass in Venice. The Palm Sunday mass, it was, first of all, very few people. And we thought like, how on Earth, in Venice, on Palm Sunday, there are only 50 people in this church? Because we were at the Latin and Gregorian mass service. And we experienced — Carlos, be still my heart. My children experienced the Latin mass, which they had not done up to this point in their lives. And it was wonderful. We had an absolutely — see, I was afraid that this — Ross is going to weep. I was afraid that this would trigger an outpouring of Rossness. But it was so beautiful. In a good way! Just to stipulate for listeners, who may have some stereotypical view of me, I do not attend the traditional Latin mass. Neither do I. And I went to Catholic — Not yet. I went to Catholic grade school, high school, and college. So I’ve been to many variations of our liturgy. And my wife and I were trying to explain to the kids, even whispering during the service, that they had entered a sort of time warp where they got to experience something that is a lot less common these days. And I think of myself as very much a Vatican II Catholic. I’m all in favor of the opening up of the liturgical experience, of the role of laypeople in the church. But it took a long time. Palm Sunday mass is generally long. And the Latin mass version is, I think, a good bit longer than normal. But even so, it was both a wonderful experience for me to think about a church before the church that I have known, and also for my children to have a sense of this experience and to have them feel — I hope some small part of them felt part of a much longer history and tradition. That’s so beautiful. You heard it here. I am hot on the Latin mass. Ross is speechless. I don’t have anything. I can’t add anything. I’m hot on the Latin mass. That sounds like a really, really amazing experience. I’m glad for you and your family. That is downright beautiful. Amazing. OK, we got to stop there before anything happens to spoil the Catholic mood. Don’t say a word. He says to the protestant! He says to Michelle. To the Southern Protestant. I have not brought the Southern Baptist into this discussion! OK, good. Guys, it’s been a pleasure. We’ll be back next week. See you next week. Good to be back. Bye, guys.

I feel like all the trains in Italy. Cancellato! Cancellato! I once got stuck in Pisa when they canceled the trains. Yeah. It was a great opportunity for me to tell my kids about the failures of European social welfare capitalism. Oh. Oh, good. Good. The kids love that. [MUSIC PLAYING] From New York Times Opinion, I’m Ross Douthat. I’m Michelle Cottle. I’m Carlos Lozada. And I’m Lydia Polgreen. And this is “Matter of Opinion.” Woo-hoo! We’re — [LAUGHTER] no, we’re reunited. We’re all recording — And it feels so good. (SINGING) Reunited — — in the same room together. I could almost touch all of my co-hosts. Please don’t. And then Carlos would call H.R. But I will not because we’re talking about disconnection, virtual alienation. We’re going to talk about kids and smartphones. Dun, dun, dun. So there is a lot of evidence that kids — American kids, maybe kids around the developed world — are not doing so well over the last 10 years. Not just in a sort of kids being kids way, but there is a real shift in rates of depression, anxiety, mental illness diagnoses, suicide and suicidality. All of these things are up for young people, and so are hours spent on smartphones. And there’s a widely circulated theory, seemingly plausible, but also hotly contested, that screens and social media are responsible for making teenagers, especially, unusually unhappy. So this is a big problem since screens and smartphones are sort of the defining technologies of our age. And I’m hoping we can resolve this problem here today in a podcast. [LAUGHTER] Maybe not. But maybe we can debate some solutions, responses, and talk about what might be going too far in our desire to protect kids. So let’s get started with a personal question. For those of you, us, who have kids or teenagers, in the house or out of the house, what are the rules for smartphones in your home? So I’ve got the oldest, I think. Mine are 20 and 18. So right now there are no rules. It’s obviously a free for all. But when they were — It’s a vicious landscape. It’s “Lord of the Flies” at Michelle’s house. The only contact I get is when somebody wants to text me for money. But — That was me, so I’m sorry about that, but — Dang, Ross! So going back, though, I think we hit the smartphone button when they were in seventh grade because that’s when they went to middle school, and that’s kind of just — that was the standard around here. And then we tried to set limits on screen times and things like that. And I have to say the pandemic made that infinitely more complicated. Carlos. So first rule of parenting is you don’t talk about parenting. [LAUGHTER] No, the first rule of parenting is that each kid is different, right? So I have three kids. One kind of mid-teens, one early teens, and one is finishing up elementary school. My oldest, who is 16, has a smartphone. He only got it last year. And he uses it mainly to be in touch with us, with his editor at the student paper, with his friends. My daughter who’s 13 has one of those little mini old-fashioned iPods which she uses to communicate with text and email with friends, with her dance group or her orchestra friends, and to listen to books. And my youngest, who’s 10, wants an Apple Watch, but isn’t getting it. [MICHELLE LAUGHS] They don’t use any kind of social media. We don’t ban it, but we discourage it. And part of the trick is that they really don’t have a lot of free time between theater, or dance, or baseball, or student journalism. They don’t have a lot of time to go on social media. We’re keeping our fingers crossed that it stays that way, at least until they reach the age of reason, the age of reasonableness. [LAUGHS] We’re still waiting on that at my house. Forty, 41. But that is — Good luck with that. — the way it works so far in our home. Huh, that’s interesting. I mean, I don’t have kids, as you all know. But I’ve tried to imagine what rules and limits would I want to set. And I think in some ways, Carlos, what you’re describing, it sounds like both an ideal but also very tough. Because in order to make sure that your kids have really, really full lives, it probably requires a lot of engagement from you and your wife. And living in the modern world — Little sleep, yes. [LAUGHTER] — we’re all very, very busy. And — Yes. And think about the way that I grew up — and we’re all Gen X — and I had perhaps an extreme version of the free range childhood. Even though my mother was technically a stay-at-home mom, she did not want to see us home all day. And we sort of ran wild. It’s hard for me to imagine wanting anything different for my own children. But I realize that’s not the world that we live in. But Ross, you have the youngest kids of all of us. So you’re just staring this down, and you have a bunch of them. So — We — well, yeah, and the oldest is 13, and she still does not have a phone of any kind. And my assumption is that we will crack and get her some kind of what my kids call a dumb phone next year for eighth grade. She is trying to negotiate with me to get a smarter phone, insisting that she would never use social media. She will probably invoke the idea that she’s so busy, the excuse — The lie my feeds are feeding me? The lie your kids are feeding you. But it is very unlikely that we would crack on that. But we really haven’t entered fully into this world. But I want to pick up on Lydia’s comment about the free range childhood, because one of the reasons we’re talking about this this week is that this debate has been running for a while, but it’s resurfaced because of a new book by Jonathan Haidt called “The Anxious Generation,” that’s basically Haidt making the case not just that there’s something specific about, let’s say, the social life of teenage girls on Instagram or TikTok or the social life of teenage boys playing video games, that’s a problem for mental health, but also that this is a substitute for exactly the kind of childhood you’re describing. So it’s not just the screens themselves are the devil. It’s also that the screens themselves have reshaped social life and eliminated certain features of childhood that taught people how to be adults, taught people how to navigate interpersonal dynamics in person, how to communicate with the opposite sex, how to settle fights on the playground with their friends, this kind of thing. Haidt has a number of critics who basically say he’s making a correlation/causation mistake. That, yes, it happens to be that mental health has gotten worse over the smartphone era, but that does not prove that the phones are the problem. Do you guys buy the argument? I mean, I’ve read the competing correlation/causation arguments, and, of course, have looked in detail at every single study and weighed them — I have been personally running regression analyses in my spare time. I was going to say, I have so many histograms, you would not believe it. [LAUGHTER] You would not believe the number of histograms. But to me, the bigger question is one of emphasis. Should we be more concerned by the vacuum that was created by putting children into a much more protective bubble? Is the problem that we need to solve the transformation of childhood into what many kids experience as much more tightly controlled and scheduled and mediated through parents as opposed to mediated through your friend groups and learning how to build your own boundaries and relationships and things like that, or do we tackle the problem at the level of smartphones? Look, I personally believe that I have a dysfunctional relationship with smartphones. And so it’s very easy for me to look at kids and be like, oh, yeah, of course they must also have a very dysfunctional relationship. But honestly, I don’t know. I think it’s always a problem to put too much emphasis on any one particular culprit, and it is generally our impulse to blame technology. I mean, TV — did TV ruin kids? Probably. But that is — I mean, look at us. — one of the panics that we had. And then for years everyone told us that violent video games absolutely positively were turning our children into sociopaths. This, on one level, is what we do. We decide it’s something that we can tackle simply or blame simply. But then there’s 30 questions I have as to what we’re really worried about here. I mean, are we upset about kids sitting around on their phones rather than playing outside, worried about them doing less in-person socializing, worried about them becoming addicted to external affirmation from their online groups, upset about them having access to scary news and inappropriate information, upset that they’re not as independent, worried about bullying? I mean, there’s so many things that fall into this category that we’ve just decided are all about smartphones. So I think the virtue of the Haidt argument, it’s a technology is doing something bad argument that has a pretty narrow and focused zone of concern. And that zone of concern is the fact that young people report being unhappier as young people than was the case generally in our cohort and preceding generations. And this pretty clearly tracks to a kind of point of divergence. I think 2012 to 2014 is sort of a break point in the data. If you just look at the charts that Haidt puts together, you say, well, yeah, something clearly happened in this window that is not just teenagers or teenagers. You need some explanation. And that’s why his critics have tended to also put forward contingent time bound speculations. Like it’s the aftermath of the financial crisis, it’s the rise of school shootings and school shooting drills. There is, I think, a quest for a particular kind of explanation because you have this divergence in the data. Now, there is also the response or argument that what we’re seeing here is just better diagnosis. That kids have had these mental health problems all the time, and, for better or worse — many people would say for better, some people would say for worse — we’re talking more about mental health. Maybe that’s the whole divergence. We’ve become more open to these discussions or more likely to offer these diagnoses, and that alone is enough to — We’re a therapeutic society. Right. We’re a therapeutic society and it’s finally achieved takeoff, and that’s where we are now. I try to be skeptical of the Haidt thesis because it confirms my priors. Like Lydia, I have a toxic relationship to my smartphone. I don’t use that much social media. But the social media I use I’m addicted to and make the excuse that it’s part of my job. So I have a natural inclination to buy into the argument. So I try and be more skeptical of it. But I think that right now it’s a pretty parsimonious explanation for at least some of this divergence. You’re saying parsimonious in a positive sense? Right. In a positive — in a positive sense, yeah. Because the data are quite dramatic. I mean, I was looking for other sources of information about this because Haidt, in his book, talks about, actually, this data is global. These are things that we’re seeing in other countries. So I was looking at other alternative sources of data on this. And there was a UNICEF report that was published in 2020. And it’s really interesting actually how much of an outlier the U.S is. And this is a place where I actually have a significant amount of skepticism about the Haidt book. It counted 38 of the wealthiest countries in the world, and the United States was 32nd in terms of mental well-being on this list. And the top five were not what you would expect. They were the Netherlands, Cyprus, Spain, Romania and Denmark. So this is just — I mean, I would have predicted Romania. Yeah, absolutely. But maybe not the rest. Absolutely. The reports in this study on the effect of technology use was one quarter the size of the effect from bullying, for example. So I came to this information saying, like, oh, yeah, this all sounds plausible. But the more I dug into other sources and other cuts at looking at this question of child happiness, the more skepticism that I had that this one explanation was enough. I think you need to take the changes of childhood and technology together. Haidt does push back against the critics who say it is a monocausal explanation by saying that, look, I’m talking about the changes to the independent childhood that we had in the ‘70s or the ‘80s versus today. And I accept that defense of his. But in some ways, if you look at just his body of work, even just his “Atlantic” articles over the years, he does feel like he’s beating the same drum over and over again with slightly different speeds. I read each piece individually and I feel persuaded. I read them together and I feel suspicious, right? I don’t mean suspicious in an ill intent on the part of the writer kind of way. But I think of a worldview that maybe explains too much. And I also wonder if different kids are different. So when I was a kid, my mother was obsessed — obsessed with us not watching too much television because she thought it was going to rot our brains. She would come home and she would put her hand on the top of the TV set. And if it was warm, she’d know — [LAUGHTER] — that we’d broken the rules. And my mother did not mess around. She’d unplugged the TV. She’d get out a pair of scissors and she’d snip off the plug. Oh my god! As a punishment, so that we would not watch it again. Totally, totally badass. We were — That’s real parenting. But I want to tell you — I want to tell you, it’s even better parenting. You know what my brothers and I did? We would go to RadioShack and we would buy a plug, and then we taught ourselves how to reattach a plug and then not make it look like — Yeah, but this is exactly — You have skills. This is the bypass of childhood. Kids are going to bypass any form of control over — But Haidt would say that is the kind of childhood creativity that is being lost, the ability to do end-arounds when your parents — To McGuyver your TV set! Exactly. Ross you mentioned school shootings. I mean, this month, believe it or not, will mark 25 years since Columbine. And the kids that Haidt is talking about are kids that have grown up entirely in a world formed by that experience. I don’t just mean Columbine, but I mean the experience of lockdown drills in schools, knowing that every day they’re going to a place where they’re meant to be taught and educated and protected, but that they feel at risk. The reason my son has a smartphone is because there were bomb threats at his school, which he covered as a student journalist. But that’s why he has a smartphone to begin with. I find that argument totally unpersuasive to explain the divergence that you see — Oh, no, no, I meant — — starting in the early 2010s. No, I’m not saying — I’m not saying — It doesn’t track, particularly, with the rise of school shootings. It doesn’t track at all with general violence in schools, which was much higher in the 1980s and early 1990s than today. And it does, allowing Lydia’s point that the data is complex, it does show up — the teenage mental health issue — in lots of other countries that don’t have active shooter drills and so on. What’s odd in this debate is that Haidt is making an argument that in a way tracks pretty well with a lot of traditional left wing preoccupations. He’s saying a bunch of big rapacious capitalist entities, in order to make a profit, are exploiting your children and destroying their mental health. And a lot of people on the left are like, no, that’s not satisfying enough. It has to be something that Republicans did, right? Because Silicon Valley isn’t coded as Republican. It has to be climate change because we can blame Republicans for that. It has to be school shootings because we can blame Michelle’s Southern relatives and their guns for that. That feels very sensitive. But — I don’t know. It’s like you’re just looking for — I mean, there are many reasons why children can be anxious all at once. I worry a little bit about Haidt pointing to smartphones as the overwhelming reason. There are multiple reasons why any one kid can be having trouble. And another — and this is where I was headed. I wasn’t saying that therefore the explanation is school shootings. In the panoply of possible reasons for kids to be struggling, another is — Lydia and Ross have mentioned that you have your own toxic addictive relationships with your phones. I mean, these are also kids who have grown up with parents — With parents, yes. — who are entirely tethered to their devices and who basically — a few years ago, I read this book by Sherry Turkle called “Reclaiming Conversation,” and she had a line that has stuck with me since then where she says that all our relationships now come with the assumption of divided attention. And that is all the more so with children seeing the divided attention that their parents, already distracted and busy and tired parents, give to them. All right, let’s take a break. And when we come back, we’ll talk about whether we should be even looking for solutions here. And if so, what they might be. [MUSIC PLAYING] One of the things that I’m interested in is when you start talking about what to do about it, then it gets really sticky, though. And I think one of the things that does bother me is when the states start looking at, well, how are we going to save our children? They start talking about putting limitations on what kids can do on their phones. And you quickly get into questions of First Amendment rights and things like this. None of which is going to matter if you’ve got kids who are watching their parents sit on their phones all day long 24/7. That’s like lecturing kids not to do drugs while you’re sitting there dropping acid. So there is a question about how we’re going to tackle this. And this just seems to be one of those areas that we rush to because it seems very easy to tackle. We’ve had several states try and limit what kids can do and what their social media account age is. But it’s a lot of constitutional questions, and a lot of time and energy going into something that doesn’t strike me is going to be all that useful. I mean, just on the personal side, Michelle’s first, right, since you’re the senior parent in this conversation, meaning the one with the most experience. Yeah, call me old. The one with the most experience. Walk that one back, Ross. The wisest. Backpedal. Your kids are basically through high school into college, right? Mhm. And if you look back over the last 10 years, setting aside the state, setting aside government, are there things that either you as a parent or you as a consumer of school-based services — are there things that you wish you had done differently or things that you wish your kids’ schools had done differently? So, now, one problem that I do think parents have is once you hit a certain age with kids, you can’t limit their screen time because they’re doing homework online. So I would try to keep limits on my kids’ screen time, and they would just be like, well, we’re just doing math homework on our computer. And unless you are going to stand over that child every minute — and let’s be clear, it wasn’t a question of I didn’t want to put in the time or effort to stand over my child. It’s also, you can’t police your children like that. I mean, you have to give your children a little bit of freedom to screw up or whatever. So it was absolutely impossible on some level. It got even worse during Covid. Yeah. And COVID — It was impossible, where it all got conflated. — completely — my kids’ friends and my kids themselves had real Covid isolation issues. And it became really dark at certain times. And it was really hard to tell whether being able to connect with their friends on their smartphones was helping or hurting or whatever because technology has taken over our lives. I tend to think that as a society when we’ve given up on being reasonable about something, we then try to put limits just on the kids. I asked my daughter, who’s 13 — I told her that we were going to have this conversation, and I asked her what she thought about rules and limits and bans. And she said she didn’t have a problem with there being rules and limiting access to certain things. She’s like, we do that for lots of other stuff that seems OK. But maybe you all should have some limits, too. She felt that — Yes! Her reaction was that it shouldn’t just be for children. That a lot of bad things happen on social media when adults use social media. Yeah. I don’t how we think we can save our children if that’s the approach that we’re going to take. Well, I guess I’ll speak up for the kids first approach then. I completely agree that obviously the example that you set for your kids makes a huge difference. And I obviously think social media and smartphones have a deranging effect on adults too. But childhood is both a era of greater personal social emotional vulnerability than adulthood and also a period in which we take for granted that it is possible to impose substantial regulations that in a free society we can’t impose on adults. And we do this with lots of things. We do this with driving. There’s lots of terrible drivers on the road, but we don’t say, oh, we can’t let adults drive because we’re showing kids that they’ll be bad drivers when they grow up. Same with alcohol, tobacco products, all of these things. And we can argue back and forth about where the exact line should be. But I do think that social media age requirements, things like banning smartphones from schools and so on, are just obvious first steps, that don’t get you close to fixing all of the problems, but are things that you should just do and see what happens. As you were talking, I was thinking about some of the cultural differences about this. I don’t think there’s any society that’s like, OK, we want to teach our children to have a healthy relationship with tobacco. But when it comes to alcohol, there is a different attitude. Alcohol is seen as an important source of conviviality, of pleasure, of enjoyment, and cultivating one’s temperate enjoyment of it is something that starts relatively early in life. And let’s set social media aside for just one second and just talk about technology and screens in general. We are all going to live in a world where screens are going to be a part of it. And I’m not going to give my baby a bottle filled with watered-down wine, right? But I might give my 13-year-old, a very, very small glass of wine watered down with seltzer at Thanksgiving or whatever. That to me feels more of an approach that I could get behind rather than just ban it. And I think about my own consumption of television. I mean, I told that very funny story about my mom and cutting the cord. The reality is that if there is a television on in a room, I cannot pay attention to anything else. I mean, if there was a television over the other side of your shoulder, Ross, I would be so distracted. Fascinating. Whereas, my wife, who grew up in a household where the TV was on all the time, can just tune it out. It’s just white noise to her. So I guess if we’re going to live in a world with these technologies, how do we prepare kids to have healthy relationships to them, to turn them into tools that can serve them? The problem is if it just takes over your entire life. [LAUGHS] To be the optimist — the cockeyed optimist here, right? Lydia brought up tobacco. The United States had a massive public health campaign against tobacco that, in fact, did lead to dramatic changes in smoking’s social acceptability and all of these things. And there is this range of proposals in Congress. There’s the Kids Online Safety Act, which would require tech platforms to make various design changes. Protect Kids on Social Media Act, which would establish an age minimum and parental consent. And then there’s this general — there’s a lot of grandstanding in Congress about what Meta has done wrong and the different ways these platforms have exploited kids. And to the extent that you find the public psychological health arguments around tech and social media persuasive, is there any law or public health measure that you would like to see pass or imagine would be helpful? Or does it just not seem like a political problem? I’m not convinced it’s a political problem. And I also think a lot about the ways in which such laws could be used. As a queer person, I think about kids who are trying to figure out who they are and what are the places that they might connect with other people like them. Obviously, I grew up in a connection desert growing up in East and West Africa. We didn’t even have a home phone for a while. So I don’t romanticize the disconnected life at all. I think loneliness has lots of different facets to it. And I think that IRL friendships are great. But friendships over distance I think can be very, very meaningful. We have a whole literature of epistolary friendships — Letter writing is another lost art — Another lost art. I mean — — that the smartphone has killed. Yeah. Voice memos on the other hand — [LAUGHTER] so, yeah, I’m skeptical about the role of legislation in this area. I mean, I think, actually, profound social changes are needed. I think that we need to rethink the way that we treat children in society, the amount of freedom, the amount of autonomy that we give them. Obviously I believe that they need to be protected from dangerous things. But — and this is just my bias from my own experience, having been a very, very independent kid — I’m a strong believer in child independence. I think laws sometimes reflect social changes and sometimes anticipate them. And I would be open to a lot of the kind of reforms that Jonathan Haidt suggests, to some degree, of limiting access to social media. I’m persuaded by the potential educational impact of smartphone bans or at least severe reductions in smartphone use in schools. At the same time, I still believe that there is a multiplicity of factors behind the mental health and well-being crisis that we’re seeing with kids in the United States. So I’m both open to them, but skeptical that they would solve the underlying issue that we’re facing. All right, well let’s close out by just looking forward a little bit, because I’m curious where you guys think this debate will be in 10 or 20 years, maybe at the point where some of our children are parenting themselves. Oh, I can’t wait for that. Can’t wait for that. And grandchildren reversing the birth dearth. [LAUGHTER] Anyway — Different podcast, Ross. Different podcast. Different episodes. Save it. But isn’t it all the same episode, Lydia? I’m curious, generally, because there’s also a way in which when technological change happens, sometimes by the time you figure out what’s going wrong in one particular dispensation, we’re headed into a new dispensation, right? So just hearing the way that schools rely on the internet and tech for assignments and so on, does that survive the age of ChatGPT and AI assistants? Is it possible that we’re going to head into a landscape where all of education is going to have to recalibrate itself? They’re never going analog again, Ross. Well, that’s — They’re not going back to analog. It’s too — it’s not going to happen. OK, but so then what is the world on the other side of AI or on the other side of any other looming technological change, on the other side of virtual reality? We don’t know. That’s what’s so great about it. Could you have predicted where we are now 20 years ago? I don’t think you could have. Come on. I mean once that’s true once Elon Musk has put chips in all of our brains, then we’ll experience the singularity and we’ll know what’s happening. All right, let me — No, no, I have a real answer here. Let me — all right, Carlos — but no, let me first say, I am detecting just an incredible level of fatalism from all three of you about technological change. Yes. And I agree with all of you that, yes, of course, we are not undoing the internet revelation — excuse me — Wow. See, Freudian — paging Dr. Freud. We know what you want, Ross. We know what I want. I want the singularity, too. But it seems to me that there’s a huge question here, which is, are we going to master these kind of technologies or be mastered by them? And I feel like, are all of you just content to drift into the Neuralink future? Carlos, the humanist, I appeal to you to close us out with resistance. Come now — Hashtag resistance. — speak for paper, speak for print, speak for analog. I only read on paper. Here I am saying that on a podcast. Who’s read “Canticle for Leibowitz“? Well, you know I have. That’s a — Not me. It’s a book that I highly recommend. It’s a book in which the existential perils of technology are taken so seriously that we attempt to fully simplify our lives to purge ourselves of these technologies. Yet, inevitably we recreate them with the same destructive results. And just because it fails, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t make the attempt. So I think it’s foolish to be optimistic in this world, but it is not foolish to be hopeful. But even as we make those attempts, I’m skeptical of a silver bullet answer to the problem that we’ve discussed today. We will simply move on to a new version of it, which then we will look back with longing on this simpler time. The way that Lydia talked about the television story, we’re going to talk about trying to — you remember back in the 2000s when we tried to regulate smartphones? And we didn’t know that the fill in the blank was coming next and that was going to be even more insidious and destructive. Brain chip. Lydia is right. Brain chip. No, but I think that’s — I think that’s a really good way of putting it, Carlos. And I think that the reality is that things stop being cool. Facebook has been abandoned to the boomers and — Oh, you cannot pay kids to be on Facebook. — other social media. And I think it’s one of those things that’s seen as a punch line. But kids reject the things that their parents are into, and are addicted to, and want to talk about, and want to focus on. And I think that things become not cool. And that’s definitely a thing that I’m seeing among young people that I know, that they’re like, you know what’s not cool is spending all your time on social media. And on that note, I’m going to return home and explain to my 13-year-old daughter that it is her duty to make the smartphone uncool in her middle school and high school. And we’ll leave it there. And when we come back, we’ll get hot and cold. Just tell her how cool you think it is and that’s going to do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, guys, it’s time to get hot cold. Who’s got one this week? I’m hot cold this week. Carlos. So I just returned from “Matter of Opinion”‘s official vacation destination, which is Italy. Italia. And I happened to be there during Holy Week. And so we did Palm Sunday mass and Easter Sunday mass in Venice. The Palm Sunday mass, it was, first of all, very few people. And we thought like, how on Earth, in Venice, on Palm Sunday, there are only 50 people in this church? Because we were at the Latin and Gregorian mass service. And we experienced — Carlos, be still my heart. My children experienced the Latin mass, which they had not done up to this point in their lives. And it was wonderful. We had an absolutely — see, I was afraid that this — Ross is going to weep. I was afraid that this would trigger an outpouring of Rossness. But it was so beautiful. In a good way! Just to stipulate for listeners, who may have some stereotypical view of me, I do not attend the traditional Latin mass. Neither do I. And I went to Catholic — Not yet. I went to Catholic grade school, high school, and college. So I’ve been to many variations of our liturgy. And my wife and I were trying to explain to the kids, even whispering during the service, that they had entered a sort of time warp where they got to experience something that is a lot less common these days. And I think of myself as very much a Vatican II Catholic. I’m all in favor of the opening up of the liturgical experience, of the role of laypeople in the church. But it took a long time. Palm Sunday mass is generally long. And the Latin mass version is, I think, a good bit longer than normal. But even so, it was both a wonderful experience for me to think about a church before the church that I have known, and also for my children to have a sense of this experience and to have them feel — I hope some small part of them felt part of a much longer history and tradition. That’s so beautiful. You heard it here. I am hot on the Latin mass. Ross is speechless. I don’t have anything. I can’t add anything. I’m hot on the Latin mass. That sounds like a really, really amazing experience. I’m glad for you and your family. That is downright beautiful. Amazing. OK, we got to stop there before anything happens to spoil the Catholic mood. Don’t say a word. He says to the protestant! He says to Michelle. To the Southern Protestant. I have not brought the Southern Baptist into this discussion! OK, good. Guys, it’s been a pleasure. We’ll be back next week. See you next week. Good to be back. Bye, guys.

My Story Was Told in ‘Hotel Rwanda.’ Here’s What I Want the World to Know Now.,"Advertisement Supported by Guest Essay Mr. Rusesabagina is the president and founder of the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation. This week, the world will again turn its eyes toward Rwanda. April 6 marks 30 years since the start of one of the most horrific events in modern history, the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Nearer in time but not unrelated, it has been just over one year since I left Rwanda and returned to the United States, released from prison after  . I have not yet spoken at length about what those years in a Rwandan prison were like, or about the daily reality for Rwandan political prisoners who, like me, found themselves behind bars for exercising their freedom of expression. It has been a long year of physical and emotional recovery that has allowed me finally to put pen to paper again, and I expect the healing process will last the rest of my life. The experience of being kidnapped, tortured, imprisoned and silenced by those whom I had used my voice to criticize is difficult to describe. At many times during my captivity I believed I would be silenced for good, and that I would never again see my wife, my children and my grandchildren. But today I am a free man. And as we face this important and difficult milestone, I feel grateful to be able to join with my fellow Rwandans and reflect on what, if anything, we can take from this terrible chapter of our shared history. For me and for so many Rwandans, the 1994 genocide remains the focal point of my life. The months of April to July 1994 were a time of incomprehensible horror, in which our beautiful country was dragged into hell by brutal violence and killings on a scale previously unimaginable. At some points in the crisis, as many as 10,000 people were butchered in a day, primarily by machetes and other crude weapons. Even now, three decades later, and even for those of us who saw the killings firsthand, it is impossible to process the depravity and the gravity of the loss. At the time, I was the manager of the Hôtel des Mille Collines in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, where I tried to protect not only my own young family but also the 1,268 people who sought shelter within the walls of the hotel. Their bravery, and our daily macabre dance with death, became the backdrop of the 2004 film “Hotel Rwanda.” This film brought to the screen our compromising, negotiating and begging with our would-be executioners to try to keep the waiting militia at bay. This experience is still difficult for each one of us to relive. I am grateful to have survived it. I am also grateful for the two personal lessons I decided to take from living through this atrocity. The first: Never, ever, ever give up. This is what sustained me when I was kidnapped in August 2020 by an operative of the Rwandan intelligence services and   in Rwanda on charges of terrorism and other crimes, along with others who were critical of the current government. The second: Words are our most effective weapons when we are confronted by those who seek to oppress and victimize others. Both of these lessons are on my mind today, as the world considers the state of Rwanda 30 years after the genocide brought us to our knees. Now Rwanda is viewed by many nations as an important global   — a partner that has bravely rebuilt itself into a thriving and inclusive modern society. But it is increasingly difficult to remain blind to the jailing — and   — of those who criticize or challenge the Rwandan government’s power. Independent journalists, human rights advocates and opposition political parties are nearly absent from the landscape of Rwandan civil society today. This is not a reconciled or inclusive society; it is an authoritarian state. The rest of the world should stop looking the other way. As a global community, we are being confronted with the rise of authoritarianism and the co-opting of institutions meant to support basic liberties, such as the freedom of press, speech and association. Throughout the world, politics is being used as a tool to promote division, and in some cases violence, in order to gain or maintain power. We continue to see the fundamental human rights that we fought so hard for being upheld only for certain people in certain circumstances. And, as is so often the case, the vulnerable members of society are the ones who pay the greatest price. Rwanda, which today lacks strong democratic institutions and free and fair elections, is not immune to these problems. I believe that it becomes the role of those of us who have been empowered by our circumstances to speak out, to act as a check on abuses of power and to resist the erosion of our fundamental rights. It is imperative to speak against those who seek to reduce civic space and basic freedoms for their own political gain, choose to fuel violence for profit and openly engage in brutal wars for material wealth. This becomes our work, even if speaking out puts us in the direct line of fire, as it has for me and my family. Thirty years on from the Rwandan genocide, there is still cause for hope. We can see young Rwandans all over the world continuing to advocate genuine reconciliation and the building of a democratic Rwanda, despite the overt risks of doing so. We can see the bravery and unfailing resolve of the women of Iran and Afghanistan and those who support them. We can see the open resistance of people in Myanmar, Ukraine, Syria and Sudan standing up to tyranny and oppression. Their courage reminds us that it is our collective duty to counter autocratic regimes and policies and promote equality and, above all, peace. This is my prayer, and hope, for the next 30 years, for Rwanda and beyond. Paul Rusesabagina served as manager of the Hôtel des Mille Collines in Kigali during the Rwandan genocide, a story later told in the film “Hotel Rwanda.” In 2005, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush. He is the president and founder of the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation. Advertisement","My Story Was Told in ‘Hotel Rwanda.’ Here’s What I Want the World to Know Now.

"Who Is Jorge Glas, an Ecuadorean Politician Arrested at Mexico’s Embassy?","Advertisement Supported by A former vice president of Ecuador, Jorge Glas had been convicted of bribery in two separate cases. He had fled to the Mexican Embassy in Quito after facing more embezzlement charges. Mexico has   after Ecuadorean police officers on Friday arrested Jorge Glas, an Ecuadorean politician who had been granted refuge in Mexico’s embassy in Quito. That arrest, which Mexico described as a “violation” of its sovereignty, capped days of growing tensions between the two Latin American countries. Ecuador has considered Mr. Glas a fugitive and said its police force was acting on an arrest warrant for Mr. Glas. Here’s what to know about the politician at the center of the dispute. Mr. Glas served in several ministerial roles under the   of a former Ecuadorean president, Rafael Correa. Mr. Glas’s most notable role was as Mr. Correa’s vice president, a position he held from 2013 to 2017. His term as vice president in the subsequent government, led by Lenín Moreno, lasted only a few months. In 2017, he was forced from office and sentenced to six years in prison after   of receiving over $13.5 million dollars in bribes. The bribes had involved Odebrecht, an international construction giant that . The corruption scandal implicated current and former officials in Latin America and has rocked its political establishment. In 2020, a separate bribery case led to Mr. Glas being found guilty of accepting money in exchange for issuing public contracts between 2012 and 2016. The case was closely watched, not only because of the involvement of Mr. Glas: among those eventually convicted of accepting some $8 million in bribes was Mr. Correa, the country’s magnetic but divisive former president. Both Mr. Correa and Mr. Glas   in prison, a conviction that Mr. Correa has claimed was politically motivated. Mr. Glas was released early from prison i , after lawyers argued that he was not safe behind bars. Facing more charges from Ecuadorean prosecutors over the alleged embezzlement of public funds, he sought asylum from Mexico in December. For months, he has stayed on the Mexican embassy’s grounds in Quito. On Friday, following days of rising tensions between Mexican and Ecuadorean officials, Mexico  . The former vice president’s asylum status has for months been a growing point of contention between the two nations. Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry   that it had requested Mexico’s permission to arrest Mr. Glas. In the days leading up to Mr. Glas’s arrest, the relationship between the two countries grew more strained after Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, appeared to question the legitimacy of Ecuador’s most recent presidential election, and publicly commented on the assassination last year of an Ecuadorean political candidate. Ecuador on Thursday   Mr. López Obrador for commenting on the assassination and declared Mexico’s ambassador a “persona non grata,” or unwelcome. In response, Mexico said that it had instructed its ambassador to return to Mexico. In the same release, Mexico said   and condemned the increased presence of Ecuadorean authorities near the embassy. Mexico has granted political asylum to other former officials in Latin American countries that have been accused of corruption, creating friction within the region. In 2019, it   to Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia, and in 2022  , the former president of Peru.

How a Vacant Lot Became Our Own Dirtbag Narnia,"Supported by Mr. Baumgarten is a photographer based in Philadelphia. On a quiet street in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, just a few steps from my back door, is a vacant lot that my wife, Anne, and I share with our neighbors. This patch of dirty ground was once three single-family homes. Bit by bit, rains have washed away the soil, revealing corners of the buildings’ foundations and the occasional broken brick and shard of glass. Anne and I moved into our house in 2013. The neighbors on our street were extremely welcoming. At the time, the block was filled with very good people living among a very bad drug problem. It was obvious that the addiction epidemic brought everyone together, as the sense of community responsibility was palpable. One of the first things our new neighbors asked us was which car was ours — so they could keep an eye out in case someone tried to break into it. In our collection of welcome materials was a yellow sticky note: “Welcome to the hood, we’re hanging in the big backyard if you want to come out.” At risk of being reductive, the story of Kensington is not unlike that of many other turn-of-the-century industrial hubs: Industry moves out, many people follow, drugs move in. Over the following years, houses and mills collapse or burn, leaving behind vacant lot after vacant lot. Among them was ours, a space that was once a dumpsite littered with spare tires, heroin needles and what was only explained by the old heads as “a sex trailer.” It wasn’t until 2012 or early 2013 when our neighbors Zach and Sawyer cleaned up the lot and started squatting on it — they even got the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society to come through and plant some trees and erect a small red fence. It was our own personal dirtbag Narnia. We began meeting back there for morning coffee. The dogs would run and roughhouse, ensuring they’d be exhausted by the time we all left for work. After work, dog play happy hours would extend late into the evening. We would sit around a fire and talk for hours about this and that — local news, crime, complaints. In true Philly form, we spoke with passion. To an outsider, it probably looked like we were arguing. We burned anything we could get our hands on — mostly old wood and cardboard scavenged from dumpsters and a nearby building demolition. But one winter, when our boiler died, we got drunk and had a bonfire to keep warm while waiting for the new one to be installed. Things got out of hand, and we ended up burning almost half of our outdoor furniture. A portion of the lot was dedicated to our garden, which featured, among other things, 15-foot fig trees. The ground in our neighborhood had long since been poisoned from the mills, tanneries and factories that had been there before, so everything had to be grown in raised beds. Melons, squash and beans snaked up a homemade trellis fashioned from an old bunk bed we found in the trash. On summer evenings, after hours of wrestling around the gardens, the dogs would fall asleep in the grass smelling like caprese salads. The lot hosted a made-up and extremely short-lived tournament dubbed the Kensington Danger Games, featuring events like How Close How Long, in which we saw who could keep their hand closest to the fire for the longest amount of time; Ladder Dash, in which we raced one another across the rungs of a horizontal elevated ladder; and Taser Tag, which is exactly what it sounds like. The tournament was abandoned just before the jousting event, which was to be conducted on broken bicycles with two-by-fours. Over the years, an endless supply of stray cats have passed through. Between the broken gazebo and abandoned compost bins, at least two cats have birthed entire families. We’ve had raccoons and opossums and squirrels. Their chosen trail is safely above the dogs, tightrope-walking the defunct phone line like it’s their own personal super highway — occasionally dropping hoagie rolls, pretzels, Tastykakes, chicken wings and other gifts from the sky. During the early days of the pandemic, we used it to have small, socially distant outdoor gatherings. In recent years, many neighbors have moved away for better opportunities: Jobs. School. A new spot closer to work. Others have left to grow their families. From that fence over the last 10 years, we’ve watched the neighborhood gentrify. Somehow, Kensington continues to look younger and newer, while on our side of the fence we’ve all gotten older and more tired. Ain’t none of us staying up past 11 p.m. anymore. Anne and I are the last ones of the original crew now. As I look over the lot from our bathroom window, all the surrounding lots are in some stage of metamorphosis — into gigantic multifamily buildings. They’ve been closing in on the lot bit by bit as the years pass. This past winter may have been our last bonfire season. We say that every year, but this year really feels like the one.

Can the Left Be Happy?,"Advertisement Supported by Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist A crucial moment in the development of modern left-wing culture arrived some time in 2013, when Ta-Nehisi Coates, reading books about the ravages and aftermath of World War II by the historians Tony Judt and Timothy Snyder, realized that he didn’t believe in God. “I don’t believe the arc of the universe bends towards justice,” Coates   for The Atlantic then. “I don’t even believe in an arc. I believe in chaos … I don’t know that it all ends badly. But I think it probably does.” I apologize for pinning so much on one writer’s existential crisis. But it’s fair to describe the author of “ ” and “ ” as the defining pundit-intellectual of the late Obama era, the writer whose work on race and American life set the tone for progressivism’s trajectory throughout the Trump years and into the great “racial reckoning” of 2020 (by which time Coates had made an enviable escape to fiction). And in his crisis of faith, his refusal of optimism, you see the question that has hung over left-wing culture throughout a period in which its influence over many American institutions has markedly increased: Does it make any sense for a left-winger to be happy? The left-wing temperament is, by nature, unhappier than the moderate and conservative alternatives. The refusal of contentment is essential to radical politics; the desire to take the givens of the world and make something better out of them is always going to be linked to less relaxed gratitude, than to more of a discontented itch. But the 20th century left had two very different anchors in a fundamental optimism: the Christianity of the American social gospel tradition, which influenced New Deal liberalism and infused the civil rights movement, and the Marxist conviction that the iron logic of historical development would eventually bring about a secular utopia — trust the science (of socialism)! What’s notable about the left in the 2020s is that neither anchor is there anymore. The secularization of left-wing politics has made the kind of Christian-inflected cosmic optimism that still defined, say, Barack Obama’s 2008   seem increasingly irrelevant or cringe-worthy. Meanwhile, the revival of Marxism and socialism has not been accompanied by any obvious recovery of faith in a Marxist science of history. I know many people on the left who think Marx was right about capitalism’s contradictions; I know many fewer who share his expectation that the dialectic will yield a worker’s paradise. Instead you have a fear that when “late capitalism” crashes, it will probably take everybody down with it, a sense we should be “learning to die” as the climate crisis worsens, a belief in white supremacy as an original sin without the clear promise of redemption. For the stern-minded, pessimism of the intellect can coexist with optimism of the will. “I’m also not a cynic,” Coates wrote in the same 2013 essay. “Those of us who reject divinity, who understand that there is no order, there is no arc, that we are night travelers on a great tundra, that stars can’t guide us, will understand that the only work that will matter, will be the work done by us.” But it should not be a surprise that some of those “night travelers on a great tundra” might incline a bit more than past left-wingers to despair. Nor should it be a surprise that amid the recent trend toward increasing youth unhappiness, the   is wider than before — that whatever is making young people unhappier (be it smartphones, climate change, secularism or populism), the effect is magnified the further left you go. The smartphone theory of increasing youth unhappiness has been especially in the news this past week, thanks to Jonathan Haidt’s new book, “ .” And it’s been striking how certain critiques of Haidt’s theory from the left seem to object to the idea that youth unhappiness could be anything but rational and natural. Take the prominent   for Nature by a child development scholar, Candice L. Odgers, which cited American “access to guns, exposure to violence, structural discrimination and racism, sexism and sexual abuse, the opioid epidemic, economic hardship and social isolation” as plausible causal alternatives to Haidt’s social-media diagnosis. The tone of the review suggested that kids really   to be a bit depressed. Wouldn’t you be, growing up amid “school shootings and increasing unrest because of racial and sexual discrimination and violence”? And for an answer to this unhappiness, with neither Providence nor scientific socialism available, Odgers turned to the therapeutic process, lamenting the dearth of school psychologists to help kids process “their symptoms and mental-health struggles.” This seems like where a good portion of the American left finds itself today: comforted by neither God nor history, and hoping vaguely that therapy can take their place.

Is New York City Overdue for a Major Earthquake?,"Advertisement Supported by Seismologists said that severe earthquakes are relatively rare around the city and cannot be predicted. But if one were to hit, it could inflict serious damage.  and  The earthquake that hit the Northeast on Friday morning rattled nerves but did not do much damage. Still, it left many New Yorkers wondering how afraid they should be of a bigger one hitting closer to the city. The answer? It’s hard to say. Some   that a large earthquake is “due” in New York City because moderate ones — with a magnitude of 5 or more — typically occur every few hundred years. The last one took place in the 1700s. Friday’s earthquake, in comparison, was a magnitude 4.8. In 2008, Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory found that the risk of earthquakes in the New York City area was greater than previously believed. That is because smaller earthquakes occur regularly in New York City, like  , in January. Experts caution that it is impossible to know when an earthquake will strike or how much damage it might cause. But if an earthquake much stronger than Friday’s were to hit closer to New York City, “it would be a different story,” said Kishor S. Jaiswal, a research structural engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey.   suggest that such a quake could result in dozens of injuries and billions of dollars in damage. There were few reports of damage or injuries after Friday’s earthquake. Still, city officials said they were inspecting bridges, train tracks and buildings, and that people should be prepared for aftershocks for at least several days. Earthquakes with a similar magnitude to Friday’s are “rare, but they’re not unheard-of” close to New York City, said  , an associate professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth College.  are often caused by the friction and movement of Earth’s tectonic plates underground. The energy that is released as a result travels in waves and causes the shaking that is felt above ground. The effect of an earthquake will depend on the location of the epicenter, how deep the earthquake was and the quality of the construction of the buildings in the area, Ms. Sonder said. “It’s really hard to predict whether a building will have damage at a magnitude 5, or if it will take a seven or an eight,” she said. The waves from an earthquake on the East Coast might be felt hundreds of miles away because of the type of rocks underground. Because the Northeast is densely populated, many people end up feeling the effects and it becomes a topic of conversation, even if it does not cause much damage, she said. There are reasons to believe New York City’s buildings might be vulnerable. But many new buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes, and some older buildings have been retrofitted, experts said. “There’s a saying that ‘earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do,’” said Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia Climate School. “That’s why it’s so important to sort of have these things in place.” The most significant tremors in New York City occurred in 1884, when  . That earthquake was about four times as strong as Friday’s, and its epicenter was dozens of miles closer to the city. (Friday’s epicenter was in New Jersey, about 40 miles west of New York City.) If an earthquake similar to that of 1884 hit the city today, officials estimate that it would “potentially cause $4.7 billion in damage to buildings, transportation, and utilities,” leave 100 buildings destroyed and 2,000 people without shelter. Old brick buildings, buildings with storefronts on the ground level and buildings with “brittle” concrete frames are the most susceptible to cracking and damage, said Abi Aghayere, a forensic structural engineering professor at Drexel University. Building codes for earthquake safety emerged around the 1930s, and many major cities have also strengthened their codes in recent years to help their infrastructure withstand strong shakes. For example, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in Midtown spent more than $50 million over 15 years ago to retrofit the bus terminal to withstand damage from a seismic event. In general, New York City has plans for every possible disaster scenario, said  , director at the N.Y.U. Rudin Center for Transportation. “We have probably the best emergency management department in the country,” Ms. Kaufman said. Once an earthquake occurs, officials’ attention quickly pivots to assessing the damage. Consolidated Edison, the electricity, gas and steam utility that services 10 million people in New York City and Westchester County, has protocols for checking for damage with an emphasis on its gas distribution network. After Friday’s earthquake, no damage was found, said Matthew Ketschke, the president of the utility.

The Point,"Opinion Writer Just before 10:30 this morning, I suddenly got a flurry of text messages from friends around New York City, some panicked and some amused, and some confused about why they had just felt the ground beneath their feet or the walls around their apartments begin to wobble and shake, a little violently, for a stretch of a few minutes. What happened, they asked, and what explained it? What did it have to do with the earthquake and tsunami in Taiwan the other day? How serious was a magnitude 4.8 earthquake? And what kind of aftershocks could be expected? Partly this confusion was because New Yorkers, like others on the East Coast, are generally speaking unused to earthquakes, although the city was hit by a much smaller one as recently as January and a bit bigger one about a decade ago. Partly it’s because earthquakes make us quite nervous, after decades of telling ourselves that, like wildfires, earthquakes are something that happens over there on the other side of the country. But partly it’s because our conventional measures of earthquakes — which we use to communicate to the public the intensity of a given earthquake and the risk it represents — are so poorly suited to the task and so utterly inscrutable to almost any nonscientist. What do I mean? The Richter scale and its modern descendants are logarithmic measures, in which every single-number increment represents a 10-fold increase in intensification. This means that an 8.0 magnitude earthquake is not twice as serious as a 4.0 magnitude one. It is 10,000 times more serious. And while it may seem, to the average New Yorker, that today’s 4.8 quake sounds a lot like the 5.8 quake that hit the East Coast in 2011, or maybe a little less intense, in fact, that quake was 10 times stronger than this one. To whom does this approach make sense? Well, the short answer is scientists, especially those interested in describing high-intensity earthquakes a little more precisely, and distinguishing between them. But the rest of us would surely be less confused if the scale were made a little more intuitive. On a linear scale, a magnitude 10 earthquake would be half as intense as a magnitude 20 one, and one-tenth as intense as a magnitude 100 one. At the very least, we wouldn’t so often respond to news of an earthquake by asking, “How bad was it?” Editorial Board Member I got my start in journalism covering the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, so the   this weekend feels personal to me. I spent months on end in the unadorned press room of the U.N. court in Arusha, Tanzania, listening as witnesses — most of them from the Tutsi ethnic minority — described the killing of more than 800,000 people on the orders of mayors and governors. I studied the faces of those mayors and governors and searched for signs of regret as they sat in the dock in suits and ties. Were they monsters? No. They were men who had been in power at a time when murdering Tutsis had become the law of the land. The great hope of international justice was that it would be a law above such laws, stopping mass slaughter with legal lines in the sand. To this day, some of my closest friends are journalists and lawyers I met back then. They went on to work in Cambodia on the trials of the Khmer Rouge and in The Hague, where they participated in the trials of former Yugoslavian leaders. Now some are working on the war crimes investigations in Ukraine. We started out as idealistic believers in international justice, inspired by a world that came together to say “never again.” Over these years, reality has always fallen short of ideals when it comes to international justice. The difference between who ends up in the dock of an international court, and who remains in charge of a murderous regime at home, can be arbitrary. But now the world is entering a new phase when powerful states don’t even pretend to care about international laws and norms. Maybe it started with the U.S. war of choice in Iraq. It continued with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now the conduct of Israel and Hamas has been a last straw that leaves many declaring international justice dead. Powerful states are not even pretending anymore to respect the Geneva Conventions. “The paradox of the moment is that there’s a clear understanding that these principles do not apply anymore,” my friend Thierry Cruvellier, editor in chief of  , told me in a phone call from Kigali, Rwanda, where he traveled for the 30th anniversary. “At the same time, there have never been so many people trying to bring cases before the International Criminal Court.” Maybe that’s the tiny ray of hope in this dark era. The clamoring for justice at the doors of the court — even if it is not delivered — proves that it is still essential. Advertisement  and  Patrick Healy , Deputy Opinion Editor Gail, I love your quizzes about politics. Your   was published this week. When did you start the quizzes? What inspired you to try that format? Gail Collins , Opinion Columnist Thanks, Patrick! It’s been an eon or two. I just found one I did back in 2010. Often, there’s something I read that I’d like to share with readers but not for a whole 800-word column. So I just stick the story in a little file called “quiznotes.” Trump claiming he’d been “indicted more than Al Capone” was in there when I wrote this last quiz. Patrick Healy Your multiple-choice answers are very funny — such as asking what Trump said at a New Hampshire rally and offering “A lot of people say I remind them of Robert Frost” as an answer. Do you shape questions so you can write joke answers? Gail Collins Sometimes, but there’s a lot of material these days. Trump may be a terrible presidential candidate, but he’s God’s gift to quiz writing. Patrick Healy What’s a favorite question you’ve asked? Gail Collins I always feel lucky to be able to revisit some crazy factoid or ungodly statement without having to devote a column to it. I randomly called up a   and was reminded that on Independence Day that year, Trump reminded the nation of the way the Revolutionary Army suffered through winter at Valley Forge and then “took over the airports.” Patrick Healy Certain people are recurring characters in quizzes; George Santos is a recent one. Gail Collins Santos may be a failure as a public official, but he is definitely a quiz superstar. Readers know who he is, and they’re ready to start laughing even before the question’s over. Patrick Healy On this week’s quiz, one reader commented, “Admit it, Gail. This one was just an elaborate scheme to get a mention of Schuyler Colfax into the paper, right?” What say you? Gail Collins Well, Colfax doesn’t come up a whole lot in normal conversation, and I’m a fan of obscure vice presidents. If I can’t get to sleep at night, sometimes I try to see if I can name, say, all the vice presidents from the 19th century.  Right now, I’m thinking the next quiz will need an Elbridge Gerry option. Opinion Writer The ground rumbled along the East Coast on Friday, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. put out a fresh statement about its recovery from a much bigger temblor in Taiwan on Wednesday. Both earthquakes were reminders that we’re living on the crust of a restless planet. Sensitive manufacturing equipment, such as that used to make the world’s most advanced computer chips, doesn’t coexist well with heavy vibrations. Picture shoving the elbow of an expert diamond cutter at the wrong moment and you get a sense of the problem. Taiwan is doubly vulnerable because T.S.M.C. makes state-of-the-art chips on which the global tech economy depends, and because the island is on several major faults. It’s near the Ring of Fire, which the   says is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world. T.S.M.C. is eager to quell fears about its reliability. Its statement on Friday cited the company’s “ample experience and capabilities in earthquake response and damage prevention, as well as regular disaster drills to ensure full readiness.” Chip fabrication facilities, known as fabs, are equipped with chip-making tools that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars each. T.S.M.C. said “overall tool recovery of our fabs reached more than 70 percent within 10 hours of the April 3 earthquake, with new fabs such as the Fab 18 facility reaching more than 80 percent.” I’m impressed by how well T.S.M.C. — and the entire island, for that matter — rode out a pretty severe earthquake. But I’m not entirely reassured. The next earthquake could be worse. And as my colleague Nicholas Kristof   in January, T.S.M.C. is vulnerable to attacks by China on Taiwan’s power grid, or a naval blockade. It makes sense to reduce the world’s over-dependence on Taiwan for so many of the building blocks of the modern digital economy. But that won’t be easy or fast. For now, we should count ourselves lucky that T.S.M.C. came through this earthquake almost unscathed. (And that the seismic threat to the East Coast is mild by comparison.) Advertisement Opinion Columnist I have mixed feelings about the filibuster. In the past I’ve supported it as a means of fostering deliberation, to slow down the legislative process so that the Senate can fulfill its   as a “necessary fence” against the presumed “fickleness and passion” of the larger and more-representative House of Representatives, in James Madison’s words. At the same time, however, I’m persuaded that it should not serve as a permanent supermajority requirement for legislation. The Constitution, after all, does not require supermajorities, and Senate rules should not cripple the constitutional order. Filibuster use against legislation has exploded right along with American polarization, and the resulting gridlock is thoroughly defeating majority rule. That means virtually all bills need 60 votes to pass. (The filibuster against nominations has already been eliminated.) So, is there a reform idea that harmonizes the intent of the Senate to serve as a thoughtful deliberative body while retaining majority rule? Two young conservatives, Thomas Koenig and Thomas Harvey,   in The Dispatch, my former writing home: “If a bill can’t obtain a filibuster-proof supermajority,” they write, “the filibuster should be reformed so that the bill can still pass through the Senate if it obtains a simple majority twice — over the course of two successive Congresses, with an election in between.” Not only does this proposal preserve the deliberative purpose of the Senate, it also would enhance participatory democracy. A party with popular (but not filibuster-proof) majorities can both run on its proposals and, crucially, follow through. As of now, candidates for both houses of Congress are constantly making promises they can’t keep. I’m still thinking through this proposal, but I’d love your thoughts. I don’t want the Senate to be a smaller version of the House, but the current gridlock is crippling our nation’s Madisonian vision for democracy. As Koenig and Harvey remind us, Madison called majority rule the “ .” One of the highlights of this job is hearing from the thoughtful people who read The Times. I’d love to hear from you about this. What do you think? My email address  . Contributing Opinion Writer Democratic operatives and pundits of all stripes are undeniably obsessed with President Biden’s low poll numbers, to a degree that disregards the length of time between now and Election Day, ignores the polling failures of recent years and erases the Democratic Party’s strong performance in the 2022 midterms and in several key state referendums and contests since. But when the nightmare before you is a second Trump term, how can you not wet the bed? Forgive my potty mouth, but the “world of Democratic bed-wetters” was the subject of   on Wednesday by Adam Nagourney. He interviewed Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist and consultant who rightly predicted that Democrats would defy the doomsayers two years ago, confidently forecasts a Biden triumph in November and scoffs at the party’s apocalyptic histrionics. Can’t we all just calm down a bit? No, we can’t. While I share the concern that excessive negativity could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, projecting weakness and prompting surrender instead of a vigorous victory effort, I also recognize that panic is inevitable — and wholly warranted — when the stakes are this huge. Donald Trump isn’t just any old major-party nominee. He isn’t even the Trump of 2016 or 2020. This time around, his autocratic aspirations are more operatic, his contempt for democratic process more firmly established and his threat to a sane and civilized American future more obvious. I’d be shocked if my inbox  lousy with emails from friends freaking out about the latest battleground-state surveys. I’d check to see if those friends were still breathing. But Rosenberg is right to question measures of Biden’s weakness, because such measures have never been this questionable. Trump’s extreme divergence from political norms suggests that normal assessments don’t suffice — or even apply. Right now, more than six months before ballots are cast, voting for Trump remains somewhat of an abstraction: There’s no great weight to telling a pollster that you’ll do that. But when the time actually comes? When you reckon fully with the endorsement and election of someone who has said all that he has said, done all that he has done and equates himself with Jesus Christ while doing a better impersonation of Lucifer? There’s no predicting that moment of decision, and as Rosenberg sagely notes, there’s still ample cause for hope. Advertisement Opinion Writer and Editor No Labels won’t be running a bipartisan unity ticket,   on Thursday. It’s not a huge surprise, given how many prospective candidates it approached are reported to have said no in the last few months, among them Joe Manchin, Larry Hogan, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie and at least one retired admiral. It’s also not surprising given the   of No Labels as an entity. Formed in response to the Tea Party era, the group has floated and abandoned various projects over the years, and often is attached to a corporate-friendly attempt at “bipartisan problem solving” that makes sense in Washington and isn’t popular elsewhere.  In recent weeks, Tom Davis, the former Republican congressman from Virginia who is a founder of No Labels, was  the possibility of a No Labels candidate winning a few states and forcing a contingent election, in which the House would decide the victor through a system not used since the 19th century. The prospect of a contingent election is a good example of the weirdness and risk of this overall project — most people would hear about that idea and worry! But the one thing No Labels can be credited with here is realizing, early, the extent of the electorate’s unhappiness with Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and the abstract potential for a third-party candidate who drew real numbers of voters. Robert Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy, despite or because of its chaotic weirdness, keeps reaching double-digit numbers in polling. It’s still not clear if he will pull more from Biden or Trump should he make the ballot this year, as my colleague Michelle Goldberg   today. Why did all these people say no to No Labels? A few of them have publicly given reasons (Haley   she was a committed Republican), and politicians can be averse to anything that might diminish their own popularity. But right now, a third-party candidacy by Haley, for example, doesn’t sound totally absurd.  So there’s also the chance that people weren’t interested in running because the odds for it to not be a total bust seemed a little too   right now — that running might peel off double-digit numbers from a major candidate, or even win a handful of states, and throw the country into something like a contingent election — and bring about unpredictable chaos. Opinion Columnist President Biden threatened on Thursday to condition aid to Israel on its treatment of civilians in Gaza. But it’s not clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will take Biden’s threats seriously — or that he needs to. Biden’s warning reflected American anxiety about the catastrophic humanitarian toll in Gaza. He is under growing pressure from senators, the public and   to do more to ease the crisis — but he has consistently been reluctant to do more than ask Netanyahu for better behavior. Even on the same day that Israel killed seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen, the Biden administration approved a major new shipment of bombs and other weapons to Israel,    . Biden has long been a staunch supporter of Israel. He belongs to a generation for which the Holocaust was a living memory and saw Israel in its days as a fragile young nation besieged by strong neighbors. He has seemed unwilling to use American leverage against Israel by slowing or stopping weapons transfers, imposing end-use restrictions on those weapons or allowing tough resolutions through the U.N. Security Council. The Biden administration did allow one Gaza resolution to go through, after vetoing  . But it then deflected questions about whether it would oblige Israel to comply by   that the resolution was nonbinding anyway (others disagreed). Before Biden’s latest threat, the White House position seemed pretty clear that the pipeline for weapons to Israel would continue, and there was nothing specific to indicate that there was some new red line. “We make no bones about the fact that we have certain issues about some of the way things are being done,” a White House spokesman, John Kirby,   Wednesday. “We also make no bones about the fact that Israel is going to continue to have American support for the fight that they’re in to eliminate the threat from Hamas.” Advertisement Editorial Board Member If there is a more justifiably frustrated man in America right now than Jack Smith, the federal special prosecutor on the Donald Trump cases, I’d like to meet him. Placed in the extraordinarily delicate position of investigating Trump for potential crimes, Smith has done everything right, bringing two tightly focused indictments against the former president last year. By now, both trials should have been well underway. Neither is anywhere close. This week Smith finally   with Aileen Cannon, the novice federal judge handling the case that involves Trump’s illegal retention of highly classified national security documents. In a bizarre order last month, Cannon called on both parties to submit proposed jury instructions, something that normally happens just before a trial starts. In the order, she also seemed not to understand either the facts of the case or the federal law governing presidential records. In  , Smith said the order was based on a “fundamentally flawed legal premise,” which is the polite way lawyers ask, “Are you really this dumb?” On top of that, Smith pointed out, Trump’s argument for why the documents belong to him — essentially, that by taking them from the White House to Mar-a-Lago, he magically converted them into his property — “is not based on any facts” but “was concocted more than a year after he left the White House.” If Cannon refuses to budge, Smith warned, he would appeal her order to the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which   an earlier mistake of hers in humiliating fashion. In an  , Cannon pushed back against Smith’s criticism, saying she was simply trying to understand each side’s position. She also rejected Trump’s interpretation of the presidential records law and refused his demand to dismiss the case. This should have been a slam-dunk case — there is a clear federal law, and Trump brazenly and willfully broke it — but Cannon has turned the litigation into a circus with   after another, many of which have benefited Trump. Those looking for conspiracies have widely noted that Cannon is a Trump appointee, but that’s a red herring; other Trump appointees had no problem ruling against him in his frivolous litigation over the 2020 election. Whatever Cannon’s motives, the best argument against her is that she is incompetent. Smith has shown a superhuman level of patience up to this point. It’s time for him to give up the charade and ask the 11th Circuit to remove her from the case and replace her with a judge who understands the job. Opinion Writer In September I wrote about  . The pipeline for teachers is drying up because college students  . It makes sense. Teachers’ job satisfaction is at a 50-year nadir. In many states, teachers receive subpar pay,   for failures and feel a palpable lack of respect for their work. A new survey of over 2,000 public K-12 teachers, released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center, echoes what I heard from educators and experts last year: American teachers are deeply unhappy with nearly every aspect of their job. In a summary of its survey, Pew wrote, “Public K-12 teachers are stressed about their jobs, and few are optimistic about the future of education; many say poverty, absenteeism and mental health are major problems at their school.” Compared with the average American worker, teachers said they were “much less satisfied,” and a staggering 77 percent described their jobs as “frequently stressful.” Nearly half of American teachers said that “the behavior of most students at their school is fair or poor,” and it doesn’t feel like a leap to make the connection between student misbehavior and the high level of teacher stress. Unsurprisingly, while “teachers in high-poverty schools have a much more negative outlook,” teachers writ large are pretty miserable, Pew notes. The most alarming finding is that 68 percent of teachers said that “they’ve experienced verbal abuse from a student — such as being yelled at or threatened.” Teachers are being asked to solve major social problems — poverty and mental health issues — that they are not equipped to fix. They are trained as educators, not as psychologists or social workers, and they cannot be expected to mend all of America’s ills. This country can’t afford to have the public school system buckle under the weight of other failures. There is a lack of structural and material support for children and their   (especially before their children are born). Until we improve the lives of American families, America’s teachers will be left to pick up the pieces. Advertisement Opinion Writer Say this for the Trump era: It continues to provide real-world civics lessons on some of the more obscure elements of our electoral system. Just think of all the Americans who know way more today than they did four years ago about voter access laws, slates of electors, the role of state secretaries of state, the vote certification process, the Electoral Count Act … I mean, what better way to teach people the importance of election integrity than to have a defeated president undermine it? Think of it as a Machiavellian “ ” for our troubled times. This is not to suggest that the Republicans’ electoral maneuverings are all shady. Sometimes they’re just cynical and self-serving but not really shady. Take    . Raise your hand if you knew that Nebraska is   that do not award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. (Ten bonus points if you can name the other one without clicking the link in the previous sentence.) In most states, the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote gets all the electoral votes. But Nebraska divvies up its five electoral votes: Two go to the winner of the overall popular vote and one to the winner in each of its three congressional districts. Since being put in place for the 1992 election, the system has, on a couple of occasions — including in 2020 — resulted in the Democratic candidate winning an electoral vote from the district containing Omaha. Republicans don’t much like it when that happens in this otherwise red state and have long been agitating to go back to the winner-take-all system. This year   to this effect was bumping around the State Legislature largely ignored until Tuesday, when the MAGA activist Charlie Kirk   his followers to call Nebraska’s governor, Jim Pillen, in support of the change on Donald Trump’s behalf. Several hours later, Pillen issued a   in praise of the proposal. Not long after that, the MAGA king himself entered the fray, voicing his support  . And just like that, the political world began buzzing about the issue, noting that in a close race, that one little electoral vote could make all the difference. Can Republicans push through the change before the legislative session ends on April 18? It could be a heavy lift, as Democratic lawmakers there get out their own civics books and gear up to block the bill. Editorial Board Member If you want to make a place truly unlivable, you don’t just bomb it and starve it. You also go after the human infrastructure — the people who can keep order, get things running after setbacks and nurture hope. I don’t want to believe that Israel is systematically targeting the human infrastructure of Gaza, but the repeated attacks on aid workers who have reported their locations to the Israeli military make it impossible not to wonder what exactly Israel is doing. There’s a pattern here, and Israel owes the world a better explanation. The deadly attack on the World Central Kitchen aid convoy, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called a tragic mistake, came after the March 8 death of Mousa Shawwa, the head of logistics for American Near East Refugee Aid, known as Anera, an aid group that has operated in Gaza for 56 years.   just days after the Israeli military confirmed the coordinates of the organization’s warehouses and safe houses. On Feb. 5,   trying to make a delivery, stopping it in its tracks, according to Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, even though its movements were coordinated with the Israeli military. Israel has accused the group, which operated as a de facto government, of sympathizing with Hamas, which the group denies. The question of which institutions can keep Gaza from descending into chaos needs an immediate answer. Private aid groups like Anera appear to be the last thread keeping Gaza from falling apart; now Anera, World Central Kitchen and other groups are suspending their work. Without food aid or any institution capable of keeping order, what will happen to two million Gazans? Once the human infrastructure of a place is gone, that place risks sinking into chaos. One right-wing Israeli,  , a settler leader, predicted that if Gazans got  , other countries would take pity on them and allow them in as refugees, leaving Gaza for Israelis to resettle. That would be a crime against humanity, and I hope it’s not the playbook that Israel is using. Advertisement Opinion Chief of Staff One chilly evening late last month, I visited my favorite bar in Bloomington, Ind., my hometown, and the conversation turned to March Madness. Hoosiers always love college basketball, but this year everyone wanted to talk about the women: Sara Scalia of Indiana University, Angel Reese of L.S.U. and, yes, Caitlin Clark of Iowa. In Indiana, as in much of the country, fans are showing up for women’s basketball, and — crucially — they’re buying tickets. I saw it myself just a few days earlier. I was in the stands at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall as the   and won their place in the Sweet Sixteen. As the players rushed the student section after the game, locals and students alike hung back to watch them revel. Though the architects of Title IX, Representative   and Senator Birch Bayh, are no longer around to see it, I can imagine this is exactly what they were hoping for when President Richard Nixon signed the law in 1972. But good policy takes time. It’s thanks to Title IX that the entire country is now talking about Caitlin Clark, who deserves her obsessive following. Clark is a  , a disciplined player and a fierce competitor. She’s the all-time leading scorer in Division I history, men or women. And she’s  . She’s very likely going to be the   at the W.N.B.A.’s draft on April 15. And there’s a good chance that she’ll end up playing for the Indiana Fever. My hope is that wherever Clark ends up, her star power fuels the W.N.B.A. There’s already an indication that “ ” — her unique ability to fill stadiums and even raise ticket prices — is real. She definitely     when Iowa was on the road. Women’s basketball deserves devoted fans, and more of them. Professional women’s basketball is ripe for the groundswell that has come for the college teams. Whether I’m watching the Fever take on the Liberty at Barclays Center later this spring or sipping beers at a local dive with the game on TV, I’ll be cheering on the women. That’s where the real fun and, yes, drama are happening this year. Opinion Columnist In 2002, the English journalist Ed West penned an essay entitled “Britain Isn’t a Free Country.” His evidence was straightforward: Through the aggressive enforcement of laws against hate speech, Britain was harassing, investigating and sometimes imprisoning its own citizens, effectively consigning the right to free expression to the dustbin of history. West’s list of examples, which included some cases involving deeply unsympathetic racists and others that looked more like the criminalization of cultural conservatism, is worth revisiting now that Scotland has passed an especially expansive hate speech statute. The new Scottish law criminalizes public speech deemed “insulting” to a protected group (as opposed to the higher bar of “abusive”), and prosecutors need only prove that the speech was “likely” to encourage hatred rather than being explicitly intended to do so. One can offer a defense based on the speech in question being “reasonable,” and there is a nod to “the importance of the right to freedom of expression.” But a plain reading of the law seems like it could license prosecutions for a comedian’s monologue or for reading biblical passages on sexual morality in public. The law has attracted special attention because J.K. Rowling responded to its passage with a series of social media posts about transgender individuals that seemed to fall afoul of the law’s dictates. If they do, she wrote, “I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment.” My prediction is that neither Rowling nor any figure of her prominence will face prosecution. Rather, what you see in West’s examples is that the speech police prefer more obscure targets: the teenage girl prosecuted for posting rap lyrics that included the N-word or the local Tory official hauled in by the cops after posting to criticize the arrest of a Christian street preacher. Which is, of course, a normal way for mild sorts of authoritarianism to work. Exceptions are made for prominent figures, lest the system look ridiculous, but ordinary people are taught not to cross the line. Europe is often depicted as caught between an embattled liberal order and a post-liberal form of populism. But the reality is that there are two incipient European post-liberalisms, both responses to the challenges of managing aging, anxious societies being transformed by mass migration. One is the right-wing politics of national identity; the other is a more technocratic attempt to maintain social peace through a regime of censorship. Scotland is experimenting with the second option. Both could usher out the liberal age as we have known it.

So it was a surprise, and a balm, to watch a man who prays daily and talks openly about his devout faith storm a bastion of earthly godlessness: “Saturday Night Live.” I am referring, of course, to the comedian Ramy Youssef, who hosted the show on what he described in his   as “an incredibly spiritual weekend,” noting Ramadan, Easter and the arrival of a new Beyoncé album. “I’m doing the Ramadan one,” he quipped, to peals of laughter, unspooling a very funny bit about how loving Muslims are. Youssef has mined his experience as a believer among the profane in gentle standup specials and a namesake sitcom. His entire monologue glowed with a welcoming warmth — Muslims, he seemed to say: We’re just like you. In a country that is supposedly obsessed with diversity and inclusion, it is remarkable how rare it is to hear from a practicing Muslim in America.  Surveys by the Institute for Policy and Understanding, a nonpartisan research organization focused on Muslim Americans, have consistently found that Muslims are the most likely group to report   in the United States. According to a   conducted in 2021, 78 percent of Americans said that there was either a lot or some discrimination against Muslims in our society. Muslims are no more likely to commit crimes than members of any other group, but crimes in which Muslims are suspects get  . It is no surprise, then, that Islamophobia is perhaps the most tolerated form of religious prejudice. Right now, Senate Republicans appear to have persuaded several Senate Democrats to   after smearing him, with no evidence at all, as an antisemite. Many of the skits that toyed with religion on “S.N.L.” on Saturday were funny — Ozempic for Ramadan! Genius. But part of me winced through them as well, because I saw in Youssef something that other members of minority groups have had to do to “earn” their place in the safety of the mainstream: the performance of normalcy, of being nonthreatening and sweet, the requirement to prove that your community belongs in America just like everyone else’s. I loved Youssef’s monologue, in which he bravely pleaded, “Please, free the people of Palestine. And please, free the hostages. All of the hostages.” “I am out of ideas,” Youssef declared toward the end of his monologue. “All I have is prayers.” To which this nonbeliever can only say: Same, Ramy. Same. Opinion Columnist The Israeli strikes that killed seven aid workers overnight as they tried to avert famine in Gaza will be much debated, but three points seem clear to me. First, the killings reinforce the widespread criticism that Israeli forces often appear to act recklessly in Gaza, with too little concern for civilian casualties. The latest deaths were unusual in that they included foreigners, even an American, but there is nothing new about Israeli strikes killing aid workers in Gaza: At least   humanitarian workers have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank since the war began in October, the United Nations says. Second, the tragedy will compound the hunger crisis in Gaza that is already leading to deaths from starvation and risking both famine and epidemics. The result is that just as famine looms and children are dying, international efforts to ease it may be reduced, not amplified. Third, Israeli credibility will take another hit, and America’s with it. Some elements of the Israeli narrative are entirely accurate: Hamas started the latest round of fighting and uses civilians as human shields. But Israel also argues that it is doing everything possible to reduce civilian casualties, and that is hard to argue in this case — and this is also an embarrassment for the Biden administration, which provides an endless flow of weaponry for airstrikes like these (although the origin of the particular weapons that killed these seven workers is unclear for now). The seven people worked with World Central Kitchen, a charity founded by chef José Andrés, and were in  . The nonprofit group, which has now suspended its aid efforts in Gaza,   that it had cleared its movements with Israeli forces, and The Financial Times   that the vehicles were hit over a two-kilometer stretch, implying targeting by multiple strikes rather than a single errant missile. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has promised an investigation. The killing of humanitarians puts aid groups in an impossible situation. The organizations focus on easing suffering, yet they also must look after the safety of their own people. If Israel continues to kill aid workers at such a pace, it will be very difficult to distribute aid to the people who need it. And increasingly, it may be essential to have trained aid workers to provide special emergency foods to children with severe acute malnutrition. All that is now uncertain. The Biden administration is issuing tougher statements about the situation, but President   to use his leverage to press Israel to ease up.   that the U.S. government is considering a major new weapons sale to Israel. Advertisement Opinion Writer Just when you thought it was safe to ignore Florida politics, up pops the state Supreme Court with an abortion-rights decision seemingly designed to provoke electoral turmoil this year. The court allowed a six-week abortion ban to go into effect while ruling that Floridians can vote in November on a state constitutional amendment to protect abortion access before fetal viability (around 24 weeks). The combined rulings immediately shoved reproductive rights to the political front lines. But how will things shake out in this  ? And not to make everything about the presidential race, but how much could it help President Biden? The issue of reproductive rights has been a boon to Democrats pretty much everywhere it has appeared on the ballot, directly or otherwise, since the death of Roe v. Wade. And there’s reason to be optimistic that Florida’s amendment will succeed as well. Though passage requires at least 60 percent support, a   by the University of North Florida put support at 62 percent, including 53 percent of Republicans. And that was before things got real with the court ruling. But can this new wrinkle save Biden there? I mean, this is Florida. The state didn’t show him the love in 2020, and more generally, its Democratic Party has been a hot mess for several years. Registered Republicans now outnumber Democrats by  . In 2022, Floridians re-elected Gov. Ron DeSantis with almost 60 percent of the vote.  . More troubling, Republican state lawmakers have shown themselves happy to thwart the will of the public to tilt the field in their team’s favor. (See:   who have completed their sentences.) And it is the adopted — and spiritual — home of perhaps the ultimate Florida Man, Donald Trump. (When thinking of the MAGA king kicked back in his so-called Southern White House, I like to picture him with a state-appropriate mullet.) With the proper mix of sweat and strategy, abortion rights advocates and Dems should be able to save reproductive rights in the state — not to mention force Republicans to burn time and cash there. But pry it away from Trump? That feels like a reach. Opinion Columnist The   of the country’s second human case of H5N1 avian flu, found in a Texas dairy farm worker following an outbreak among cows, is worrying and requires prompt and vigorous action. While officials have so far said the possibility of cow-to-cow transmission “cannot be ruled out,” I think we can go further than that. The geography of the outbreak — sick cows in Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and New Mexico — strongly suggests cows are infecting each other as they move around various farms. The most likely scenario seems to be that a new strain of H5N1 is spreading among cows, rather than the cows being individually infected by sick birds. Avian flu is not known to transmit well among mammals, including humans, and until now, almost all known cases of H5N1 in humans were people in extended close contact with sick birds. But a cow outbreak — something  , as cows aren’t highly prone to get this — along with likely transmission between cows, means we need to quickly require testing of all dairy workers on affected farms as well as their close contacts, and sample cows in all the dairy farms around the country. It is possible — and much easier — to contain an early outbreak when an emergent virus isn’t yet adapted to a new host and perhaps not as transmissible. If it gets out and establishes a foothold, then all bets are off. With fatality rates estimated up to 50 percent among humans, H5N1 is not something to gamble with. Additionally, H5N1 was found in the unpasteurized milk of sick cows. Unpasteurized milk, already a bad idea, would be additionally dangerous to consume right now. Public officials need to get on top of this quickly, and transparently, telling us the uncertainties as well as their actions. The government needs to gear up to potentially mass-produce vaccines quickly ( , though they take time to produce) and ensure early supplies for frontline and health care workers. It’s possible that worst-case scenarios aren’t going to come true — yet. But evolution is exactly how viruses get to do things they couldn’t do before, and letting this deadly one have time to explore the landscape in a potential new host is a disastrously bad idea. Advertisement Opinion Writer I come today not to bury Mike Johnson, but to praise him. No. Seriously. I mean it. Johnson, the House speaker,   with Trey Gowdy of Fox News over the weekend to discuss “realistic expectations” for Republicans in this era of narrowly divided government. Quipping that he was there as an “ambassador of hope on Easter Sunday,” Johnson offered “three simple things” his party should be focusing on: No. 1, “Show the American people what we’re for. Not just what we’re against.” No. 2, “We have to unite. We have to stand together.” And No. 3, “We’ve got to drive our conservative agenda and get the incremental wins that are still possible right now.” Nos. 1 and 2 are the sort of meaningless boilerplate politicians are forever blathering about. But No. 3 was clearly the core message of his mission, and he really leaned in, repeatedly noting that his team’s right-wingers — with whom he has long identified, mind you — need to come to terms with the political reality of holding “the smallest majority in U.S. history.” “We got to realize I can’t throw a Hail Mary pass on every single play,” he said, with that mild manner and beatific smile that makes him seem thoughtful and genial even when he’s speaking harsh truths. “It’s three yards and a cloud of dust. Right? We’ve got to get the next first down. Keep moving.” Southerners do love their football metaphors. When asked about Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s motion to remove him, he acknowledged that she is “very frustrated” with how certain negotiations have gone of late, especially when it comes to spending. “Guess what? So am I,” he said. But with Republicans clinging to the majority by their fingernails, “we’re sometimes going to get legislation that we don’t like.” This kind of squish talk isn’t very MAGA. And working with Dems is what got the previous speaker kicked to the curb. (Poor Kev.) But Johnson is in some ways in a better spot than was Kevin McCarthy. A smattering of Democrats have suggested they would save Johnson from a coup attempt, especially on a key issue such as funding Ukraine. Plus, ousting another speaker so soon would only lock in House Republicans’ rep as a bunch of hopeless chaos monkeys — not a shrewd move in an election year. This is not to say that Johnson is shaping up to be an effective or competent speaker. But it takes a certain courage to talk reality — and math — to today’s House Republicans. Kudos to him for going there. Opinion Columnist Last week I wrote a rather long column   for children are a bad idea, even if you are persuaded (as I am) that smartphones and social media are a significant reason for increasing childhood mental health struggles. My basic point was simple: The First Amendment rights of children and adults are too precious to diminish, especially when there are less restrictive alternatives for combating the problem. I received an enormous amount of helpful feedback, but I want to briefly highlight one response. The American Enterprise Institute’s Brad Wilcox   that began like this: “Could not disagree more w/   here, partly because he doesn’t fully ack how much the teen problem w/ social media is not just about the message(s) but the *medium* itself. Social media does not function like some debating society for teens.” I respect Wilcox greatly, and he’s got many valuable things to say about kids and social media, but he’s wrong in one key respect: Social media is, in fact, a debating society for teens, just as it is for adults. It’s often a miserable and contentious debating society, but social media is where an immense amount of our nation’s substantive debates takes place. Kids debate one another, and they read adult debates. Protecting political speech is a core purpose of the First Amendment. As the Supreme Court held in  , “Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.” One reason children enjoy First Amendment rights is that they are essentially citizens in training. They have to learn how to engage in political debate. There are certainly issues with the medium itself, and there are ways to combat the pernicious effects of the medium without obliterating access to the content. The First Amendment, for example, permits   of freedom of expression, and it’s easy to see a valid ban on smartphones during school hours. It’s also worth considering whether certain features of social media — such as   — could be limited. But it’s important to note that time, place and manner restrictions can’t function as a form of disguised content discrimination. If you’re looking for reasons to ban social media because of what’s on the platform, then you’re playing a dangerous constitutional game. Advertisement Opinion Writer Last week, former President Donald Trump hawked his “God Bless the USA Bible”  , stating “we must make America pray again.” In a story published today, The Times’s Michael C. Bender   — despite a background few would call pious — “is framing his 2024 bid as a fight for Christianity, telling a convention of Christian broadcasters that ‘just like in the battles of the past, we still need the hand of our Lord.’” A   in the United States from The Public Religion Research Institute suggests that Trump’s attempts to tie Christianity tightly to a particular set of Republican political values may be turning some Americans away from Christianity. P.R.R.I. surveyed Americans who left their childhood religions to become “unaffiliated,” a group that includes people who call themselves atheists, agnostics and nothing in particular. The vast majority of people who become unaffiliated are Christians. While the largest percentage say they left religion because they no longer believe the religion’s teachings, 47 percent of those who became unaffiliated say they did so because of negative treatment or teaching about L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, and 20 percent say they became unaffiliated because their church or congregation became too focused on politics. “Among white Christian groups, the largest decline in the past decade took place among white evangelical Protestants, whose numbers saw a 3 percentage point decrease, from 17 percent in 2013 to 14 percent in 2023. In 2023, the percentages of white mainline/non-evangelical Protestants (14 percent) and white Catholics (12 percent) remain largely similar to those of 2013,” according to P.R.R.I.’s survey. Trump   and   with white evangelical Christians. P.R.R.I.’s findings align with   those leaving religion. As one woman I spoke to put it, she became less religious “because evangelicals became apostates who worship Trump, nationalism and the Republican Party.” Trump promoting a Bible is just another example of his modus operandi: He may make a quick buck, but at what cost to the institution in the long run? Whether it’s a political or religious institution, the outcome always appears to be the same. Deputy Opinion Editor One of the worst things that can happen to a president seeking re-election is to have voters stop listening to you. As the campaign unfolds this week, I’m curious whether President Biden says or does things that really command attention from voters, and in particular might be persuasive to swing voters. My curiosity stems from reading   and my colleague Nate Cohn’s   on Saturday. This is how Nate summed up Biden’s standing in the race since his strong State of the Union speech on March 7: “It has gotten harder to see signs of any Biden bump. Taken together, new polls from  ,   and   suggested that the presidential race was essentially unchanged, with Mr. Trump still holding a narrow lead nationwide. The president’s approval rating doesn’t seem discernibly higher, either.” Now, State of the Union speeches themselves rarely produce a bump. But Biden was a new man in March, with a sharper message, lots of campaigning, strong ads and any number of Trump comments to whack. Yet we enter April with Trump in a narrow lead. Something is not working for Joe Biden right now. Trump is behind him in  , tied up in court, making   and posting videos showing Biden hogtied. For all that, Biden doesn’t seem to have changed large numbers of minds. Are voters still listening to the president? Previous presidents who lost re-election, including Trump, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, struggled to persuade voters they were effective and sympathetic. In their own ways, the three men were seen as all talk, no action, and that’s what some progressive Democrats and young voters think about Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza. While his administration is talking tougher about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the bombs keep falling on Gaza (and   are on the way) and the aid keeps being blocked from reaching starving people. And it’s not just Gaza: It’s immigration, abortion rights and, especially, the economy. Nate Silver had   last week showing how “even as consumer and investor sentiment has improved, President Biden’s approval rating  , or at least it  .” Right now, Biden doesn’t have the same galvanizing, persuasive political narrative for swing voters that he had in 2020 — I think Trump nostalgia is very real — nor does he have the results enough voters want. Some voters have already written him off because of his age. But I think the bigger threat to re-election is that more voters will stop listening to him if he doesn’t offer a stronger narrative and stronger results. Advertisement","The Point Opinion Writer Just before 10:30 this morning, I suddenly got a flurry of text messages from friends around New York City, some panicked and some amused, and some confused about why they had just felt the ground beneath their feet or the walls around their apartments begin to wobble and shake, a little violently, for a stretch of a few minutes. What happened, they asked, and what explained it? What did it have to do with the earthquake and tsunami in Taiwan the other day? How serious was a magnitude 4.8 earthquake? And what kind of aftershocks could be expected? Partly this confusion was because New Yorkers, like others on the East Coast, are generally speaking unused to earthquakes, although the city was hit by a much smaller one as recently as January and a bit bigger one about a decade ago. Partly it’s because earthquakes make us quite nervous, after decades of telling ourselves that, like wildfires, earthquakes are something that happens over there on the other side of the country. But partly it’s because our conventional measures of earthquakes — which we use to communicate to the public the intensity of a given earthquake and the risk it represents — are so poorly suited to the task and so utterly inscrutable to almost any nonscientist. What do I mean? The Richter scale and its modern descendants are logarithmic measures, in which every single-number increment represents a 10-fold increase in intensification. This means that an 8.0 magnitude earthquake is not twice as serious as a 4.0 magnitude one. It is 10,000 times more serious. And while it may seem, to the average New Yorker, that today’s 4.8 quake sounds a lot like the 5.8 quake that hit the East Coast in 2011, or maybe a little less intense, in fact, that quake was 10 times stronger than this one. To whom does this approach make sense? Well, the short answer is scientists, especially those interested in describing high-intensity earthquakes a little more precisely, and distinguishing between them. But the rest of us would surely be less confused if the scale were made a little more intuitive. On a linear scale, a magnitude 10 earthquake would be half as intense as a magnitude 20 one, and one-tenth as intense as a magnitude 100 one. At the very least, we wouldn’t so often respond to news of an earthquake by asking, “How bad was it?” Editorial Board Member I got my start in journalism covering the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, so the   this weekend feels personal to me. I spent months on end in the unadorned press room of the U.N. court in Arusha, Tanzania, listening as witnesses — most of them from the Tutsi ethnic minority — described the killing of more than 800,000 people on the orders of mayors and governors. I studied the faces of those mayors and governors and searched for signs of regret as they sat in the dock in suits and ties. Were they monsters? No. They were men who had been in power at a time when murdering Tutsis had become the law of the land. The great hope of international justice was that it would be a law above such laws, stopping mass slaughter with legal lines in the sand. To this day, some of my closest friends are journalists and lawyers I met back then. They went on to work in Cambodia on the trials of the Khmer Rouge and in The Hague, where they participated in the trials of former Yugoslavian leaders. Now some are working on the war crimes investigations in Ukraine. We started out as idealistic believers in international justice, inspired by a world that came together to say “never again.” Over these years, reality has always fallen short of ideals when it comes to international justice. The difference between who ends up in the dock of an international court, and who remains in charge of a murderous regime at home, can be arbitrary. But now the world is entering a new phase when powerful states don’t even pretend to care about international laws and norms. Maybe it started with the U.S. war of choice in Iraq. It continued with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now the conduct of Israel and Hamas has been a last straw that leaves many declaring international justice dead. Powerful states are not even pretending anymore to respect the Geneva Conventions. “The paradox of the moment is that there’s a clear understanding that these principles do not apply anymore,” my friend Thierry Cruvellier, editor in chief of  , told me in a phone call from Kigali, Rwanda, where he traveled for the 30th anniversary. “At the same time, there have never been so many people trying to bring cases before the International Criminal Court.” Maybe that’s the tiny ray of hope in this dark era. The clamoring for justice at the doors of the court — even if it is not delivered — proves that it is still essential. Advertisement  and  Patrick Healy , Deputy Opinion Editor Gail, I love your quizzes about politics. Your   was published this week. When did you start the quizzes? What inspired you to try that format? Gail Collins , Opinion Columnist Thanks, Patrick! It’s been an eon or two. I just found one I did back in 2010. Often, there’s something I read that I’d like to share with readers but not for a whole 800-word column. So I just stick the story in a little file called “quiznotes.” Trump claiming he’d been “indicted more than Al Capone” was in there when I wrote this last quiz. Patrick Healy Your multiple-choice answers are very funny — such as asking what Trump said at a New Hampshire rally and offering “A lot of people say I remind them of Robert Frost” as an answer. Do you shape questions so you can write joke answers? Gail Collins Sometimes, but there’s a lot of material these days. Trump may be a terrible presidential candidate, but he’s God’s gift to quiz writing. Patrick Healy What’s a favorite question you’ve asked? Gail Collins I always feel lucky to be able to revisit some crazy factoid or ungodly statement without having to devote a column to it. I randomly called up a   and was reminded that on Independence Day that year, Trump reminded the nation of the way the Revolutionary Army suffered through winter at Valley Forge and then “took over the airports.” Patrick Healy Certain people are recurring characters in quizzes; George Santos is a recent one. Gail Collins Santos may be a failure as a public official, but he is definitely a quiz superstar. Readers know who he is, and they’re ready to start laughing even before the question’s over. Patrick Healy On this week’s quiz, one reader commented, “Admit it, Gail. This one was just an elaborate scheme to get a mention of Schuyler Colfax into the paper, right?” What say you? Gail Collins Well, Colfax doesn’t come up a whole lot in normal conversation, and I’m a fan of obscure vice presidents. If I can’t get to sleep at night, sometimes I try to see if I can name, say, all the vice presidents from the 19th century.  Right now, I’m thinking the next quiz will need an Elbridge Gerry option. Opinion Writer The ground rumbled along the East Coast on Friday, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. put out a fresh statement about its recovery from a much bigger temblor in Taiwan on Wednesday. Both earthquakes were reminders that we’re living on the crust of a restless planet. Sensitive manufacturing equipment, such as that used to make the world’s most advanced computer chips, doesn’t coexist well with heavy vibrations. Picture shoving the elbow of an expert diamond cutter at the wrong moment and you get a sense of the problem. Taiwan is doubly vulnerable because T.S.M.C. makes state-of-the-art chips on which the global tech economy depends, and because the island is on several major faults. It’s near the Ring of Fire, which the   says is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world. T.S.M.C. is eager to quell fears about its reliability. Its statement on Friday cited the company’s “ample experience and capabilities in earthquake response and damage prevention, as well as regular disaster drills to ensure full readiness.” Chip fabrication facilities, known as fabs, are equipped with chip-making tools that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars each. T.S.M.C. said “overall tool recovery of our fabs reached more than 70 percent within 10 hours of the April 3 earthquake, with new fabs such as the Fab 18 facility reaching more than 80 percent.” I’m impressed by how well T.S.M.C. — and the entire island, for that matter — rode out a pretty severe earthquake. But I’m not entirely reassured. The next earthquake could be worse. And as my colleague Nicholas Kristof   in January, T.S.M.C. is vulnerable to attacks by China on Taiwan’s power grid, or a naval blockade. It makes sense to reduce the world’s over-dependence on Taiwan for so many of the building blocks of the modern digital economy. But that won’t be easy or fast. For now, we should count ourselves lucky that T.S.M.C. came through this earthquake almost unscathed. (And that the seismic threat to the East Coast is mild by comparison.) Advertisement Opinion Columnist I have mixed feelings about the filibuster. In the past I’ve supported it as a means of fostering deliberation, to slow down the legislative process so that the Senate can fulfill its   as a “necessary fence” against the presumed “fickleness and passion” of the larger and more-representative House of Representatives, in James Madison’s words. At the same time, however, I’m persuaded that it should not serve as a permanent supermajority requirement for legislation. The Constitution, after all, does not require supermajorities, and Senate rules should not cripple the constitutional order. Filibuster use against legislation has exploded right along with American polarization, and the resulting gridlock is thoroughly defeating majority rule. That means virtually all bills need 60 votes to pass. (The filibuster against nominations has already been eliminated.) So, is there a reform idea that harmonizes the intent of the Senate to serve as a thoughtful deliberative body while retaining majority rule? Two young conservatives, Thomas Koenig and Thomas Harvey,   in The Dispatch, my former writing home: “If a bill can’t obtain a filibuster-proof supermajority,” they write, “the filibuster should be reformed so that the bill can still pass through the Senate if it obtains a simple majority twice — over the course of two successive Congresses, with an election in between.” Not only does this proposal preserve the deliberative purpose of the Senate, it also would enhance participatory democracy. A party with popular (but not filibuster-proof) majorities can both run on its proposals and, crucially, follow through. As of now, candidates for both houses of Congress are constantly making promises they can’t keep. I’m still thinking through this proposal, but I’d love your thoughts. I don’t want the Senate to be a smaller version of the House, but the current gridlock is crippling our nation’s Madisonian vision for democracy. As Koenig and Harvey remind us, Madison called majority rule the “ .” One of the highlights of this job is hearing from the thoughtful people who read The Times. I’d love to hear from you about this. What do you think? My email address  . Contributing Opinion Writer Democratic operatives and pundits of all stripes are undeniably obsessed with President Biden’s low poll numbers, to a degree that disregards the length of time between now and Election Day, ignores the polling failures of recent years and erases the Democratic Party’s strong performance in the 2022 midterms and in several key state referendums and contests since. But when the nightmare before you is a second Trump term, how can you not wet the bed? Forgive my potty mouth, but the “world of Democratic bed-wetters” was the subject of   on Wednesday by Adam Nagourney. He interviewed Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist and consultant who rightly predicted that Democrats would defy the doomsayers two years ago, confidently forecasts a Biden triumph in November and scoffs at the party’s apocalyptic histrionics. Can’t we all just calm down a bit? No, we can’t. While I share the concern that excessive negativity could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, projecting weakness and prompting surrender instead of a vigorous victory effort, I also recognize that panic is inevitable — and wholly warranted — when the stakes are this huge. Donald Trump isn’t just any old major-party nominee. He isn’t even the Trump of 2016 or 2020. This time around, his autocratic aspirations are more operatic, his contempt for democratic process more firmly established and his threat to a sane and civilized American future more obvious. I’d be shocked if my inbox  lousy with emails from friends freaking out about the latest battleground-state surveys. I’d check to see if those friends were still breathing. But Rosenberg is right to question measures of Biden’s weakness, because such measures have never been this questionable. Trump’s extreme divergence from political norms suggests that normal assessments don’t suffice — or even apply. Right now, more than six months before ballots are cast, voting for Trump remains somewhat of an abstraction: There’s no great weight to telling a pollster that you’ll do that. But when the time actually comes? When you reckon fully with the endorsement and election of someone who has said all that he has said, done all that he has done and equates himself with Jesus Christ while doing a better impersonation of Lucifer? There’s no predicting that moment of decision, and as Rosenberg sagely notes, there’s still ample cause for hope. Advertisement Opinion Writer and Editor No Labels won’t be running a bipartisan unity ticket,   on Thursday. It’s not a huge surprise, given how many prospective candidates it approached are reported to have said no in the last few months, among them Joe Manchin, Larry Hogan, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie and at least one retired admiral. It’s also not surprising given the   of No Labels as an entity. Formed in response to the Tea Party era, the group has floated and abandoned various projects over the years, and often is attached to a corporate-friendly attempt at “bipartisan problem solving” that makes sense in Washington and isn’t popular elsewhere.  In recent weeks, Tom Davis, the former Republican congressman from Virginia who is a founder of No Labels, was  the possibility of a No Labels candidate winning a few states and forcing a contingent election, in which the House would decide the victor through a system not used since the 19th century. The prospect of a contingent election is a good example of the weirdness and risk of this overall project — most people would hear about that idea and worry! But the one thing No Labels can be credited with here is realizing, early, the extent of the electorate’s unhappiness with Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and the abstract potential for a third-party candidate who drew real numbers of voters. Robert Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy, despite or because of its chaotic weirdness, keeps reaching double-digit numbers in polling. It’s still not clear if he will pull more from Biden or Trump should he make the ballot this year, as my colleague Michelle Goldberg   today. Why did all these people say no to No Labels? A few of them have publicly given reasons (Haley   she was a committed Republican), and politicians can be averse to anything that might diminish their own popularity. But right now, a third-party candidacy by Haley, for example, doesn’t sound totally absurd.  So there’s also the chance that people weren’t interested in running because the odds for it to not be a total bust seemed a little too   right now — that running might peel off double-digit numbers from a major candidate, or even win a handful of states, and throw the country into something like a contingent election — and bring about unpredictable chaos. Opinion Columnist President Biden threatened on Thursday to condition aid to Israel on its treatment of civilians in Gaza. But it’s not clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will take Biden’s threats seriously — or that he needs to. Biden’s warning reflected American anxiety about the catastrophic humanitarian toll in Gaza. He is under growing pressure from senators, the public and   to do more to ease the crisis — but he has consistently been reluctant to do more than ask Netanyahu for better behavior. Even on the same day that Israel killed seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen, the Biden administration approved a major new shipment of bombs and other weapons to Israel,    . Biden has long been a staunch supporter of Israel. He belongs to a generation for which the Holocaust was a living memory and saw Israel in its days as a fragile young nation besieged by strong neighbors. He has seemed unwilling to use American leverage against Israel by slowing or stopping weapons transfers, imposing end-use restrictions on those weapons or allowing tough resolutions through the U.N. Security Council. The Biden administration did allow one Gaza resolution to go through, after vetoing  . But it then deflected questions about whether it would oblige Israel to comply by   that the resolution was nonbinding anyway (others disagreed). Before Biden’s latest threat, the White House position seemed pretty clear that the pipeline for weapons to Israel would continue, and there was nothing specific to indicate that there was some new red line. “We make no bones about the fact that we have certain issues about some of the way things are being done,” a White House spokesman, John Kirby,   Wednesday. “We also make no bones about the fact that Israel is going to continue to have American support for the fight that they’re in to eliminate the threat from Hamas.” Advertisement Editorial Board Member If there is a more justifiably frustrated man in America right now than Jack Smith, the federal special prosecutor on the Donald Trump cases, I’d like to meet him. Placed in the extraordinarily delicate position of investigating Trump for potential crimes, Smith has done everything right, bringing two tightly focused indictments against the former president last year. By now, both trials should have been well underway. Neither is anywhere close. This week Smith finally   with Aileen Cannon, the novice federal judge handling the case that involves Trump’s illegal retention of highly classified national security documents. In a bizarre order last month, Cannon called on both parties to submit proposed jury instructions, something that normally happens just before a trial starts. In the order, she also seemed not to understand either the facts of the case or the federal law governing presidential records. In  , Smith said the order was based on a “fundamentally flawed legal premise,” which is the polite way lawyers ask, “Are you really this dumb?” On top of that, Smith pointed out, Trump’s argument for why the documents belong to him — essentially, that by taking them from the White House to Mar-a-Lago, he magically converted them into his property — “is not based on any facts” but “was concocted more than a year after he left the White House.” If Cannon refuses to budge, Smith warned, he would appeal her order to the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which   an earlier mistake of hers in humiliating fashion. In an  , Cannon pushed back against Smith’s criticism, saying she was simply trying to understand each side’s position. She also rejected Trump’s interpretation of the presidential records law and refused his demand to dismiss the case. This should have been a slam-dunk case — there is a clear federal law, and Trump brazenly and willfully broke it — but Cannon has turned the litigation into a circus with   after another, many of which have benefited Trump. Those looking for conspiracies have widely noted that Cannon is a Trump appointee, but that’s a red herring; other Trump appointees had no problem ruling against him in his frivolous litigation over the 2020 election. Whatever Cannon’s motives, the best argument against her is that she is incompetent. Smith has shown a superhuman level of patience up to this point. It’s time for him to give up the charade and ask the 11th Circuit to remove her from the case and replace her with a judge who understands the job. Opinion Writer In September I wrote about  . The pipeline for teachers is drying up because college students  . It makes sense. Teachers’ job satisfaction is at a 50-year nadir. In many states, teachers receive subpar pay,   for failures and feel a palpable lack of respect for their work. A new survey of over 2,000 public K-12 teachers, released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center, echoes what I heard from educators and experts last year: American teachers are deeply unhappy with nearly every aspect of their job. In a summary of its survey, Pew wrote, “Public K-12 teachers are stressed about their jobs, and few are optimistic about the future of education; many say poverty, absenteeism and mental health are major problems at their school.” Compared with the average American worker, teachers said they were “much less satisfied,” and a staggering 77 percent described their jobs as “frequently stressful.” Nearly half of American teachers said that “the behavior of most students at their school is fair or poor,” and it doesn’t feel like a leap to make the connection between student misbehavior and the high level of teacher stress. Unsurprisingly, while “teachers in high-poverty schools have a much more negative outlook,” teachers writ large are pretty miserable, Pew notes. The most alarming finding is that 68 percent of teachers said that “they’ve experienced verbal abuse from a student — such as being yelled at or threatened.” Teachers are being asked to solve major social problems — poverty and mental health issues — that they are not equipped to fix. They are trained as educators, not as psychologists or social workers, and they cannot be expected to mend all of America’s ills. This country can’t afford to have the public school system buckle under the weight of other failures. There is a lack of structural and material support for children and their   (especially before their children are born). Until we improve the lives of American families, America’s teachers will be left to pick up the pieces. Advertisement Opinion Writer Say this for the Trump era: It continues to provide real-world civics lessons on some of the more obscure elements of our electoral system. Just think of all the Americans who know way more today than they did four years ago about voter access laws, slates of electors, the role of state secretaries of state, the vote certification process, the Electoral Count Act … I mean, what better way to teach people the importance of election integrity than to have a defeated president undermine it? Think of it as a Machiavellian “ ” for our troubled times. This is not to suggest that the Republicans’ electoral maneuverings are all shady. Sometimes they’re just cynical and self-serving but not really shady. Take    . Raise your hand if you knew that Nebraska is   that do not award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. (Ten bonus points if you can name the other one without clicking the link in the previous sentence.) In most states, the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote gets all the electoral votes. But Nebraska divvies up its five electoral votes: Two go to the winner of the overall popular vote and one to the winner in each of its three congressional districts. Since being put in place for the 1992 election, the system has, on a couple of occasions — including in 2020 — resulted in the Democratic candidate winning an electoral vote from the district containing Omaha. Republicans don’t much like it when that happens in this otherwise red state and have long been agitating to go back to the winner-take-all system. This year   to this effect was bumping around the State Legislature largely ignored until Tuesday, when the MAGA activist Charlie Kirk   his followers to call Nebraska’s governor, Jim Pillen, in support of the change on Donald Trump’s behalf. Several hours later, Pillen issued a   in praise of the proposal. Not long after that, the MAGA king himself entered the fray, voicing his support  . And just like that, the political world began buzzing about the issue, noting that in a close race, that one little electoral vote could make all the difference. Can Republicans push through the change before the legislative session ends on April 18? It could be a heavy lift, as Democratic lawmakers there get out their own civics books and gear up to block the bill. Editorial Board Member If you want to make a place truly unlivable, you don’t just bomb it and starve it. You also go after the human infrastructure — the people who can keep order, get things running after setbacks and nurture hope. I don’t want to believe that Israel is systematically targeting the human infrastructure of Gaza, but the repeated attacks on aid workers who have reported their locations to the Israeli military make it impossible not to wonder what exactly Israel is doing. There’s a pattern here, and Israel owes the world a better explanation. The deadly attack on the World Central Kitchen aid convoy, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called a tragic mistake, came after the March 8 death of Mousa Shawwa, the head of logistics for American Near East Refugee Aid, known as Anera, an aid group that has operated in Gaza for 56 years.   just days after the Israeli military confirmed the coordinates of the organization’s warehouses and safe houses. On Feb. 5,   trying to make a delivery, stopping it in its tracks, according to Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, even though its movements were coordinated with the Israeli military. Israel has accused the group, which operated as a de facto government, of sympathizing with Hamas, which the group denies. The question of which institutions can keep Gaza from descending into chaos needs an immediate answer. Private aid groups like Anera appear to be the last thread keeping Gaza from falling apart; now Anera, World Central Kitchen and other groups are suspending their work. Without food aid or any institution capable of keeping order, what will happen to two million Gazans? Once the human infrastructure of a place is gone, that place risks sinking into chaos. One right-wing Israeli,  , a settler leader, predicted that if Gazans got  , other countries would take pity on them and allow them in as refugees, leaving Gaza for Israelis to resettle. That would be a crime against humanity, and I hope it’s not the playbook that Israel is using. Advertisement Opinion Chief of Staff One chilly evening late last month, I visited my favorite bar in Bloomington, Ind., my hometown, and the conversation turned to March Madness. Hoosiers always love college basketball, but this year everyone wanted to talk about the women: Sara Scalia of Indiana University, Angel Reese of L.S.U. and, yes, Caitlin Clark of Iowa. In Indiana, as in much of the country, fans are showing up for women’s basketball, and — crucially — they’re buying tickets. I saw it myself just a few days earlier. I was in the stands at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall as the   and won their place in the Sweet Sixteen. As the players rushed the student section after the game, locals and students alike hung back to watch them revel. Though the architects of Title IX, Representative   and Senator Birch Bayh, are no longer around to see it, I can imagine this is exactly what they were hoping for when President Richard Nixon signed the law in 1972. But good policy takes time. It’s thanks to Title IX that the entire country is now talking about Caitlin Clark, who deserves her obsessive following. Clark is a  , a disciplined player and a fierce competitor. She’s the all-time leading scorer in Division I history, men or women. And she’s  . She’s very likely going to be the   at the W.N.B.A.’s draft on April 15. And there’s a good chance that she’ll end up playing for the Indiana Fever. My hope is that wherever Clark ends up, her star power fuels the W.N.B.A. There’s already an indication that “ ” — her unique ability to fill stadiums and even raise ticket prices — is real. She definitely     when Iowa was on the road. Women’s basketball deserves devoted fans, and more of them. Professional women’s basketball is ripe for the groundswell that has come for the college teams. Whether I’m watching the Fever take on the Liberty at Barclays Center later this spring or sipping beers at a local dive with the game on TV, I’ll be cheering on the women. That’s where the real fun and, yes, drama are happening this year. Opinion Columnist In 2002, the English journalist Ed West penned an essay entitled “Britain Isn’t a Free Country.” His evidence was straightforward: Through the aggressive enforcement of laws against hate speech, Britain was harassing, investigating and sometimes imprisoning its own citizens, effectively consigning the right to free expression to the dustbin of history. West’s list of examples, which included some cases involving deeply unsympathetic racists and others that looked more like the criminalization of cultural conservatism, is worth revisiting now that Scotland has passed an especially expansive hate speech statute. The new Scottish law criminalizes public speech deemed “insulting” to a protected group (as opposed to the higher bar of “abusive”), and prosecutors need only prove that the speech was “likely” to encourage hatred rather than being explicitly intended to do so. One can offer a defense based on the speech in question being “reasonable,” and there is a nod to “the importance of the right to freedom of expression.” But a plain reading of the law seems like it could license prosecutions for a comedian’s monologue or for reading biblical passages on sexual morality in public. The law has attracted special attention because J.K. Rowling responded to its passage with a series of social media posts about transgender individuals that seemed to fall afoul of the law’s dictates. If they do, she wrote, “I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment.” My prediction is that neither Rowling nor any figure of her prominence will face prosecution. Rather, what you see in West’s examples is that the speech police prefer more obscure targets: the teenage girl prosecuted for posting rap lyrics that included the N-word or the local Tory official hauled in by the cops after posting to criticize the arrest of a Christian street preacher. Which is, of course, a normal way for mild sorts of authoritarianism to work. Exceptions are made for prominent figures, lest the system look ridiculous, but ordinary people are taught not to cross the line. Europe is often depicted as caught between an embattled liberal order and a post-liberal form of populism. But the reality is that there are two incipient European post-liberalisms, both responses to the challenges of managing aging, anxious societies being transformed by mass migration. One is the right-wing politics of national identity; the other is a more technocratic attempt to maintain social peace through a regime of censorship. Scotland is experimenting with the second option. Both could usher out the liberal age as we have known it. Advertisement Opinion Columnist It is a rare thing in our rapidly secularizing country to be confronted with piety and devotion in popular culture. So it was a surprise, and a balm, to watch a man who prays daily and talks openly about his devout faith storm a bastion of earthly godlessness: “Saturday Night Live.” I am referring, of course, to the comedian Ramy Youssef, who hosted the show on what he described in his   as “an incredibly spiritual weekend,” noting Ramadan, Easter and the arrival of a new Beyoncé album. “I’m doing the Ramadan one,” he quipped, to peals of laughter, unspooling a very funny bit about how loving Muslims are. Youssef has mined his experience as a believer among the profane in gentle standup specials and a namesake sitcom. His entire monologue glowed with a welcoming warmth — Muslims, he seemed to say: We’re just like you. In a country that is supposedly obsessed with diversity and inclusion, it is remarkable how rare it is to hear from a practicing Muslim in America.  Surveys by the Institute for Policy and Understanding, a nonpartisan research organization focused on Muslim Americans, have consistently found that Muslims are the most likely group to report   in the United States. According to a   conducted in 2021, 78 percent of Americans said that there was either a lot or some discrimination against Muslims in our society. Muslims are no more likely to commit crimes than members of any other group, but crimes in which Muslims are suspects get  . It is no surprise, then, that Islamophobia is perhaps the most tolerated form of religious prejudice. Right now, Senate Republicans appear to have persuaded several Senate Democrats to   after smearing him, with no evidence at all, as an antisemite. Many of the skits that toyed with religion on “S.N.L.” on Saturday were funny — Ozempic for Ramadan! Genius. But part of me winced through them as well, because I saw in Youssef something that other members of minority groups have had to do to “earn” their place in the safety of the mainstream: the performance of normalcy, of being nonthreatening and sweet, the requirement to prove that your community belongs in America just like everyone else’s. I loved Youssef’s monologue, in which he bravely pleaded, “Please, free the people of Palestine. And please, free the hostages. All of the hostages.” “I am out of ideas,” Youssef declared toward the end of his monologue. “All I have is prayers.” To which this nonbeliever can only say: Same, Ramy. Same. Opinion Columnist The Israeli strikes that killed seven aid workers overnight as they tried to avert famine in Gaza will be much debated, but three points seem clear to me. First, the killings reinforce the widespread criticism that Israeli forces often appear to act recklessly in Gaza, with too little concern for civilian casualties. The latest deaths were unusual in that they included foreigners, even an American, but there is nothing new about Israeli strikes killing aid workers in Gaza: At least   humanitarian workers have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank since the war began in October, the United Nations says. Second, the tragedy will compound the hunger crisis in Gaza that is already leading to deaths from starvation and risking both famine and epidemics. The result is that just as famine looms and children are dying, international efforts to ease it may be reduced, not amplified. Third, Israeli credibility will take another hit, and America’s with it. Some elements of the Israeli narrative are entirely accurate: Hamas started the latest round of fighting and uses civilians as human shields. But Israel also argues that it is doing everything possible to reduce civilian casualties, and that is hard to argue in this case — and this is also an embarrassment for the Biden administration, which provides an endless flow of weaponry for airstrikes like these (although the origin of the particular weapons that killed these seven workers is unclear for now). The seven people worked with World Central Kitchen, a charity founded by chef José Andrés, and were in  . The nonprofit group, which has now suspended its aid efforts in Gaza,   that it had cleared its movements with Israeli forces, and The Financial Times   that the vehicles were hit over a two-kilometer stretch, implying targeting by multiple strikes rather than a single errant missile. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has promised an investigation. The killing of humanitarians puts aid groups in an impossible situation. The organizations focus on easing suffering, yet they also must look after the safety of their own people. If Israel continues to kill aid workers at such a pace, it will be very difficult to distribute aid to the people who need it. And increasingly, it may be essential to have trained aid workers to provide special emergency foods to children with severe acute malnutrition. All that is now uncertain. The Biden administration is issuing tougher statements about the situation, but President   to use his leverage to press Israel to ease up.   that the U.S. government is considering a major new weapons sale to Israel. Advertisement Opinion Writer Just when you thought it was safe to ignore Florida politics, up pops the state Supreme Court with an abortion-rights decision seemingly designed to provoke electoral turmoil this year. The court allowed a six-week abortion ban to go into effect while ruling that Floridians can vote in November on a state constitutional amendment to protect abortion access before fetal viability (around 24 weeks). The combined rulings immediately shoved reproductive rights to the political front lines. But how will things shake out in this  ? And not to make everything about the presidential race, but how much could it help President Biden? The issue of reproductive rights has been a boon to Democrats pretty much everywhere it has appeared on the ballot, directly or otherwise, since the death of Roe v. Wade. And there’s reason to be optimistic that Florida’s amendment will succeed as well. Though passage requires at least 60 percent support, a   by the University of North Florida put support at 62 percent, including 53 percent of Republicans. And that was before things got real with the court ruling. But can this new wrinkle save Biden there? I mean, this is Florida. The state didn’t show him the love in 2020, and more generally, its Democratic Party has been a hot mess for several years. Registered Republicans now outnumber Democrats by  . In 2022, Floridians re-elected Gov. Ron DeSantis with almost 60 percent of the vote.  . More troubling, Republican state lawmakers have shown themselves happy to thwart the will of the public to tilt the field in their team’s favor. (See:   who have completed their sentences.) And it is the adopted — and spiritual — home of perhaps the ultimate Florida Man, Donald Trump. (When thinking of the MAGA king kicked back in his so-called Southern White House, I like to picture him with a state-appropriate mullet.) With the proper mix of sweat and strategy, abortion rights advocates and Dems should be able to save reproductive rights in the state — not to mention force Republicans to burn time and cash there. But pry it away from Trump? That feels like a reach. Opinion Columnist The   of the country’s second human case of H5N1 avian flu, found in a Texas dairy farm worker following an outbreak among cows, is worrying and requires prompt and vigorous action. While officials have so far said the possibility of cow-to-cow transmission “cannot be ruled out,” I think we can go further than that. The geography of the outbreak — sick cows in Texas, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and New Mexico — strongly suggests cows are infecting each other as they move around various farms. The most likely scenario seems to be that a new strain of H5N1 is spreading among cows, rather than the cows being individually infected by sick birds. Avian flu is not known to transmit well among mammals, including humans, and until now, almost all known cases of H5N1 in humans were people in extended close contact with sick birds. But a cow outbreak — something  , as cows aren’t highly prone to get this — along with likely transmission between cows, means we need to quickly require testing of all dairy workers on affected farms as well as their close contacts, and sample cows in all the dairy farms around the country. It is possible — and much easier — to contain an early outbreak when an emergent virus isn’t yet adapted to a new host and perhaps not as transmissible. If it gets out and establishes a foothold, then all bets are off. With fatality rates estimated up to 50 percent among humans, H5N1 is not something to gamble with. Additionally, H5N1 was found in the unpasteurized milk of sick cows. Unpasteurized milk, already a bad idea, would be additionally dangerous to consume right now. Public officials need to get on top of this quickly, and transparently, telling us the uncertainties as well as their actions. The government needs to gear up to potentially mass-produce vaccines quickly ( , though they take time to produce) and ensure early supplies for frontline and health care workers. It’s possible that worst-case scenarios aren’t going to come true — yet. But evolution is exactly how viruses get to do things they couldn’t do before, and letting this deadly one have time to explore the landscape in a potential new host is a disastrously bad idea. Advertisement Opinion Writer I come today not to bury Mike Johnson, but to praise him. No. Seriously. I mean it. Johnson, the House speaker,   with Trey Gowdy of Fox News over the weekend to discuss “realistic expectations” for Republicans in this era of narrowly divided government. Quipping that he was there as an “ambassador of hope on Easter Sunday,” Johnson offered “three simple things” his party should be focusing on: No. 1, “Show the American people what we’re for. Not just what we’re against.” No. 2, “We have to unite. We have to stand together.” And No. 3, “We’ve got to drive our conservative agenda and get the incremental wins that are still possible right now.” Nos. 1 and 2 are the sort of meaningless boilerplate politicians are forever blathering about. But No. 3 was clearly the core message of his mission, and he really leaned in, repeatedly noting that his team’s right-wingers — with whom he has long identified, mind you — need to come to terms with the political reality of holding “the smallest majority in U.S. history.” “We got to realize I can’t throw a Hail Mary pass on every single play,” he said, with that mild manner and beatific smile that makes him seem thoughtful and genial even when he’s speaking harsh truths. “It’s three yards and a cloud of dust. Right? We’ve got to get the next first down. Keep moving.” Southerners do love their football metaphors. When asked about Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s motion to remove him, he acknowledged that she is “very frustrated” with how certain negotiations have gone of late, especially when it comes to spending. “Guess what? So am I,” he said. But with Republicans clinging to the majority by their fingernails, “we’re sometimes going to get legislation that we don’t like.” This kind of squish talk isn’t very MAGA. And working with Dems is what got the previous speaker kicked to the curb. (Poor Kev.) But Johnson is in some ways in a better spot than was Kevin McCarthy. A smattering of Democrats have suggested they would save Johnson from a coup attempt, especially on a key issue such as funding Ukraine. Plus, ousting another speaker so soon would only lock in House Republicans’ rep as a bunch of hopeless chaos monkeys — not a shrewd move in an election year. This is not to say that Johnson is shaping up to be an effective or competent speaker. But it takes a certain courage to talk reality — and math — to today’s House Republicans. Kudos to him for going there. Opinion Columnist Last week I wrote a rather long column   for children are a bad idea, even if you are persuaded (as I am) that smartphones and social media are a significant reason for increasing childhood mental health struggles. My basic point was simple: The First Amendment rights of children and adults are too precious to diminish, especially when there are less restrictive alternatives for combating the problem. I received an enormous amount of helpful feedback, but I want to briefly highlight one response. The American Enterprise Institute’s Brad Wilcox   that began like this: “Could not disagree more w/   here, partly because he doesn’t fully ack how much the teen problem w/ social media is not just about the message(s) but the *medium* itself. Social media does not function like some debating society for teens.” I respect Wilcox greatly, and he’s got many valuable things to say about kids and social media, but he’s wrong in one key respect: Social media is, in fact, a debating society for teens, just as it is for adults. It’s often a miserable and contentious debating society, but social media is where an immense amount of our nation’s substantive debates takes place. Kids debate one another, and they read adult debates. Protecting political speech is a core purpose of the First Amendment. As the Supreme Court held in  , “Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.” One reason children enjoy First Amendment rights is that they are essentially citizens in training. They have to learn how to engage in political debate. There are certainly issues with the medium itself, and there are ways to combat the pernicious effects of the medium without obliterating access to the content. The First Amendment, for example, permits   of freedom of expression, and it’s easy to see a valid ban on smartphones during school hours. It’s also worth considering whether certain features of social media — such as   — could be limited. But it’s important to note that time, place and manner restrictions can’t function as a form of disguised content discrimination. If you’re looking for reasons to ban social media because of what’s on the platform, then you’re playing a dangerous constitutional game. Advertisement Opinion Writer Last week, former President Donald Trump hawked his “God Bless the USA Bible”  , stating “we must make America pray again.” In a story published today, The Times’s Michael C. Bender   — despite a background few would call pious — “is framing his 2024 bid as a fight for Christianity, telling a convention of Christian broadcasters that ‘just like in the battles of the past, we still need the hand of our Lord.’” A   in the United States from The Public Religion Research Institute suggests that Trump’s attempts to tie Christianity tightly to a particular set of Republican political values may be turning some Americans away from Christianity. P.R.R.I. surveyed Americans who left their childhood religions to become “unaffiliated,” a group that includes people who call themselves atheists, agnostics and nothing in particular. The vast majority of people who become unaffiliated are Christians. While the largest percentage say they left religion because they no longer believe the religion’s teachings, 47 percent of those who became unaffiliated say they did so because of negative treatment or teaching about L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, and 20 percent say they became unaffiliated because their church or congregation became too focused on politics. “Among white Christian groups, the largest decline in the past decade took place among white evangelical Protestants, whose numbers saw a 3 percentage point decrease, from 17 percent in 2013 to 14 percent in 2023. In 2023, the percentages of white mainline/non-evangelical Protestants (14 percent) and white Catholics (12 percent) remain largely similar to those of 2013,” according to P.R.R.I.’s survey. Trump   and   with white evangelical Christians. P.R.R.I.’s findings align with   those leaving religion. As one woman I spoke to put it, she became less religious “because evangelicals became apostates who worship Trump, nationalism and the Republican Party.” Trump promoting a Bible is just another example of his modus operandi: He may make a quick buck, but at what cost to the institution in the long run? Whether it’s a political or religious institution, the outcome always appears to be the same. Deputy Opinion Editor One of the worst things that can happen to a president seeking re-election is to have voters stop listening to you. As the campaign unfolds this week, I’m curious whether President Biden says or does things that really command attention from voters, and in particular might be persuasive to swing voters. My curiosity stems from reading   and my colleague Nate Cohn’s   on Saturday. This is how Nate summed up Biden’s standing in the race since his strong State of the Union speech on March 7: “It has gotten harder to see signs of any Biden bump. Taken together, new polls from  ,   and   suggested that the presidential race was essentially unchanged, with Mr. Trump still holding a narrow lead nationwide. The president’s approval rating doesn’t seem discernibly higher, either.” Now, State of the Union speeches themselves rarely produce a bump. But Biden was a new man in March, with a sharper message, lots of campaigning, strong ads and any number of Trump comments to whack. Yet we enter April with Trump in a narrow lead. Something is not working for Joe Biden right now. Trump is behind him in  , tied up in court, making   and posting videos showing Biden hogtied. For all that, Biden doesn’t seem to have changed large numbers of minds. Are voters still listening to the president? Previous presidents who lost re-election, including Trump, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, struggled to persuade voters they were effective and sympathetic. In their own ways, the three men were seen as all talk, no action, and that’s what some progressive Democrats and young voters think about Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza. While his administration is talking tougher about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the bombs keep falling on Gaza (and   are on the way) and the aid keeps being blocked from reaching starving people. And it’s not just Gaza: It’s immigration, abortion rights and, especially, the economy. Nate Silver had   last week showing how “even as consumer and investor sentiment has improved, President Biden’s approval rating  , or at least it  .” Right now, Biden doesn’t have the same galvanizing, persuasive political narrative for swing voters that he had in 2020 — I think Trump nostalgia is very real — nor does he have the results enough voters want. Some voters have already written him off because of his age. But I think the bigger threat to re-election is that more voters will stop listening to him if he doesn’t offer a stronger narrative and stronger results.

Mexico Breaks Diplomatic Ties With Ecuador After Arrest at Embassy,"Advertisement Supported by Jorge Glas, a former vice president, had taken refuge at the Mexican Embassy in Ecuador’s capital. Mexico’s president called his arrest a violation of international law.  and  Ecuadorean police on Friday night arrested a politician who had taken refuge in the Mexican Embassy in Quito, after what Mexico described as a forced entry that violated the country’s sovereignty.

Donald Trump’s Insatiable Bloodlust,"Advertisement Supported by Maureen Dowd Opinion Columnist, writing from Washington. An earthquake. An eclipse. A bridge collapse. A freak blizzard. A biblical flood. Donald Trump leading in battleground states. Apocalyptic vibes are stirred by Trump’s violent rhetoric and talk of blood baths. If he’s not elected, he bellowed in Ohio, there will be a blood bath in the auto industry. At his Michigan rally on Tuesday, he said there would be a blood bath at the border, speaking from a podium with a banner reading, “Stop Biden’s border blood bath.” He has warned that, without him in the Oval, there will be an “Oppenheimer”-like doomsday; we will lose World War III and America will be devastated by “weapons, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before.” “And the only thing standing between you and its obliteration is me,” Trump has said. An unspoken Trump threat is that there will be a blood bath again in Washington, like Jan. 6, if he doesn’t win. That is why he calls the criminals who stormed the Capitol “hostages” and “unbelievable patriots.” He starts some rallies with a dystopian remix of the national anthem, sung by the “J6 Prison Choir,” and his own reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance. The bloody-minded Trump luxuriates in the language of tyrants. In “Macbeth,” Shakespeare uses blood imagery to chart the creation of a tyrant. Those words echo in Washington as Ralph Fiennes stars in a thrilling Simon Godwin production of “MacBeth” for the Shakespeare Theater Company, opening Tuesday. “The raw power grab that excites Lady Macbeth and incites her husband to regicide feels especially pertinent now, when the dangers of autocracy loom over political discussions,” Peter Marks wrote in The Washington Post about the production with Fiennes and Indira Varma (the lead sand snake in “Game of Thrones.”) Trump’s raw power grab after his 2020 loss may have failed, but he’s inflaming his base with language straight out of Macbeth’s trip to hell. “Blood will have blood,” as Macbeth says. One of the witches, the weird sisters, urges him, “Be bloody, bold and resolute.” Another weird sister, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is predicting end times. “God is sending America strong signs to tell us to repent,” she tweeted on Friday. “Earthquakes and eclipses and many more things to come. I pray that our country listens.” Like Macbeth, Trump crossed a line and won’t turn back. The Irish say, “You may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.” Macbeth killed his king, then said: “I am in blood. Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o’er.” The Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey   that since Trump put his daughter-in-law in charge of the Republican National Committee, prospective employees are asked if they think the election was stolen. Republicans once burbled on about patriotism and defending America. Now denying democracy is a litmus test for employment in the Formerly Grand Old Party. My Irish immigrant father lived through the cruel “No Irish Need Apply” era. I’m distraught that our mosaic may shatter. But Trump   Hitleresque phrases to stir racial hatred. He has talked about immigrants “poisoning the blood of our country.” Last month, he called migrants “animals,” saying, “I don’t know if you call them ‘people,’ in some cases. They’re not people, in my opinion.” Trump’s obsession with bloodlines was   by his father, the son of a German immigrant. He thinks there is good blood and bad blood, superior blood and inferior blood. Fred Trump taught his son that their family’s success was genetic, reminiscent of Hitler’s creepy faith in eugenics. “The family subscribes to a racehorse theory of human development,” the Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told PBS. “They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man, you get a superior offspring.” Trump has been talking about this as far back as an “Oprah” show in 1988. The “gene believer” brought it up in a 2020 speech in Minnesota denouncing refugees. “A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe?” he told the crowd about their pioneer lineage, adding: “The racehorse theory, you think we’re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota.” As Stephen Greenblatt writes in “Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics,” usurpers don’t ascend to the throne without complicity. Republican enablers do all they can to cozy up to their would-be dictator, even introducing a bill to rename Dulles airport for Trump. Democrats responded by introducing a bill to name a prison in Florida for Trump. “Why, in some circumstances, does evidence of mendacity, crudeness or cruelty serve not as a fatal disadvantage but as an allure, attracting ardent followers?” Greenblatt asked. “Why do otherwise proud and self-respecting people submit to the sheer effrontery of the tyrant, his sense that he can get away with saying and doing anything he likes, his spectacular indecency?” Like Macbeth’s castle, the Trump campaign has, as Lady Macbeth put it, “the smell of blood,” and “all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten” it.

One of the witches, the weird sisters, urges him, “Be bloody, bold and resolute.” Another weird sister, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is predicting end times. “God is sending America strong signs to tell us to repent,” she tweeted on Friday. “Earthquakes and eclipses and many more things to come. I pray that our country listens.” Like Macbeth, Trump crossed a line and won’t turn back. The Irish say, “You may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.” Macbeth killed his king, then said: “I am in blood. Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o’er.” The Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey   that since Trump put his daughter-in-law in charge of the Republican National Committee, prospective employees are asked if they think the election was stolen. Republicans once burbled on about patriotism and defending America. Now denying democracy is a litmus test for employment in the Formerly Grand Old Party. My Irish immigrant father lived through the cruel “No Irish Need Apply” era. I’m distraught that our mosaic may shatter. But Trump   Hitleresque phrases to stir racial hatred. He has talked about immigrants “poisoning the blood of our country.” Last month, he called migrants “animals,” saying, “I don’t know if you call them ‘people,’ in some cases. They’re not people, in my opinion.” Trump’s obsession with bloodlines was   by his father, the son of a German immigrant. He thinks there is good blood and bad blood, superior blood and inferior blood. Fred Trump taught his son that their family’s success was genetic, reminiscent of Hitler’s creepy faith in eugenics. “The family subscribes to a racehorse theory of human development,” the Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told PBS. “They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man, you get a superior offspring.” Trump has been talking about this as far back as an “Oprah” show in 1988. The “gene believer” brought it up in a 2020 speech in Minnesota denouncing refugees. “A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe?” he told the crowd about their pioneer lineage, adding: “The racehorse theory, you think we’re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota.” As Stephen Greenblatt writes in “Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics,” usurpers don’t ascend to the throne without complicity. Republican enablers do all they can to cozy up to their would-be dictator, even introducing a bill to rename Dulles airport for Trump. Democrats responded by introducing a bill to name a prison in Florida for Trump. “Why, in some circumstances, does evidence of mendacity, crudeness or cruelty serve not as a fatal disadvantage but as an allure, attracting ardent followers?” Greenblatt asked. “Why do otherwise proud and self-respecting people submit to the sheer effrontery of the tyrant, his sense that he can get away with saying and doing anything he likes, his spectacular indecency?” Like Macbeth’s castle, the Trump campaign has, as Lady Macbeth put it, “the smell of blood,” and “all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten” it.

The Eclipse That Ended a War and Shook the Gods Forever,"Thales, a Greek philosopher 2,600 years ago, is celebrated for predicting a famous solar eclipse and founding what came to be known as science. Supported by William J. Broad studied the history of science in graduate school and still follows it for the light it casts on modern developments. In the spring of 585 B.C. in the Eastern Mediterranean, the moon came out of nowhere to hide the face of the sun, turning day into night. Back then, solar eclipses were cloaked in scary uncertainty. But a Greek philosopher was said to have predicted the sun’s disappearance. His name was Thales. He lived on the Anatolian coast — now in Turkey but then a cradle of early Greek civilization — and was said to have acquired his unusual power by abandoning the gods. The eclipse had an immediate worldly impact. The kingdoms of the Medes and Lydian had waged a brutal war for years. But the eclipse was interpreted as a very bad omen, and the armies quickly laid down their arms. The terms of peace included the marriage of the daughter of the king of Lydia to the son of the Median king. The impiety of Thales had a more enduring impact, his reputation soaring over the ages. Herodotus told of his foretelling. Aristotle called Thales the first person to fathom nature. The classical age of Greece honored him as the foremost of its seven wise men. Today, the tale illustrates the awe of the ancients at the sun’s disappearance and their great surprise that a philosopher knew it beforehand. The episode also marks a turning point. For ages, eclipses of the sun were feared as portents of calamity. Kings trembled. Then, roughly 2,600 years ago, Thales led a philosophical charge that replaced superstition with rational eclipse prediction. Today astronomers can determine — to the second — when the sun   will disappear across North America. Weather permitting, it’s expected to be the most-viewed astronomical event in American history, astonishing millions of sky watchers. “Everywhere you look, from modern times back, everyone wanted predictions” of what the heavens would hold, said  , an Assyriologist at the Free University of Berlin. He said Babylonian kings “were scared to death by eclipses.” In response, the rulers scanned the sky in efforts to anticipate bad omens, placate the gods and “strengthen their legitimacy.” By all accounts, Thales initiated the rationalist view. He’s often considered the world’s first scientist — the founder of a radical new way of thinking. Patricia F. O’Grady,   on the Greek philosopher, called Thales “brilliant, veracious, and courageously speculative.” She described his great accomplishment as seeing that the fraught world of human experience results not from the whims of the gods but “nature itself,” initiating civilization’s hunt for its secrets. Long before Thales, the ancient landscape bore hints of successful eclipse prediction. Modern experts   — one of the world’s most famous prehistoric sites, its construction begun some 5,000 years ago — may have been able to warn of lunar and solar eclipses. While the ancient Chinese and   noted the dates of eclipses, few early cultures learned how to predict the disappearances. The first clear evidence of success comes from Babylonia — an empire of ancient Mesopotamia in which court astronomers made nightly observations of the moon and planets, typically in relation to gods and magic, astrology and number mysticism. Starting  , Babylonian clay tablets bear eclipse reports. From ages of eclipse tallies, the Babylonians were able to discern patterns of heavenly cycles and eclipse seasons. Court officials could then warn of godly displeasure and try to avoid the punishments, such as a king’s fall. The most extreme measure was to employ a scapegoat. The substitute king performed all the usual rites and duties — including those of marriage. The substitute king and queen were then   to the gods, the true king having been hidden until the danger passed. Initially, the Babylonians focused on recording and predicting eclipses of the moon, not the sun. The   let them observe a greater number of lunar disappearances. The Earth’s shadow is so large that, during a lunar eclipse, it blocks sunlight from an immense region of outer space, making the moon’s disappearance and reappearance   on the planet’s night side. The size difference is reversed in a solar eclipse. The moon’s relatively small shadow makes observation of the totality — the sun’s complete vanishing — quite limited in geographic scope. In April, the totality path over North America will   between 108 and 122 miles. Ages ago, the same geometry ruled. So the Babylonians, by reason of opportunity, focused on the moon. Eventually, they   that lunar eclipses tend to repeat themselves every 6,585 days — or roughly every 18 years. That led to breakthroughs in foreseeing lunar eclipse probabilities despite their knowing little of the cosmic realities behind the disappearances. “They could predict them very well,” said  , a historian of ancient sciences at Brown University and a contributor to  , “Eclipse and Revelation.” This was the world into which Thales was born. He grew up in Miletus, a Greek city on Anatolia’s west coast. It was  . The city’s fleets established wide trade routes and a large number of colonies that paid tribute, making Miletus wealthy and a star of early Greek civilization before Athens rose to prominence. Thales was said to have come from one of the distinguished families of Miletus, to have traveled to Egypt and  , and to have studied the stars. Plato   how Thales had once tumbled down a well while examining the night sky. A maidservant, he reported, teased the thinker for being so eager to know the heavens that he ignored what lay at his feet. It was Herodotus who, in “The Histories,”   of Thales’s predicting the solar eclipse that ended the war. He said the ancient philosopher had anticipated the date of the sun’s disappearance to “within the year” of the actual event — a far cry from today’s precision. Modern experts, starting in 1864, nonetheless   on the ancient claim. Many saw it as apocryphal. In 1957, Otto Neugebauer, a historian of science,   it “very doubtful.” In recent years, the claim has received new support. The updates rest on knowledge of the kind of observational cycles that Babylon pioneered. The patterns are seen as letting Thales make solar predictions that — if not a sure thing — could nevertheless succeed from time to time. If Stonehenge might do it occasionally, why not Thales? Mark Littmann, an astronomer, and  , a retired NASA astrophysicist who specializes in eclipses, argue in  , “Totality,” that the date of the war eclipse was relatively easy to predict, but not its exact location. As a result, they  , Thales “could have warned of the   of a solar eclipse.” Leo Dubal, a retired Swiss physicist who   artifacts from the ancient past and   Thales, agreed. The Greek philosopher could have known the date with great certainty while being unsure about the places where the eclipse might be visible, such as at the war’s front lines. In an interview and a  , Dr. Dubal argued that generations of historians have confused the philosopher’s informed hunch with the precision of a modern prediction. He said Thales had gotten it exactly right — just as the ancient Greeks declared. “He was lucky,” Dr. Dubal said, calling such happenstance a regular part of the discovery process in scientific investigation. Over the ages, Greek astronomers learned more about the Babylonian cycles and used that knowledge as a basis for advancing their own work. What was marginal in the days of Thales became more reliable — including foreknowledge of solar eclipses. The Antikythera mechanism, a stunningly complex mechanical device, is a testament to the Greek progress. It was made four centuries after Thales, in the second century B.C., and was   off a Greek isle in 1900. Its   let it predict many cosmic events, including solar eclipse dates — though not, as usual, their narrow totality paths. For ages, even into the Renaissance, astronomers kept upgrading their eclipse predictions based on what the Babylonians had pioneered. The 18-year cycle, Dr. Steele of Brown University said, “had a really long history because it worked.” Then came a revolution. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus put the sun — not Earth — at the center of planetary motions. His breakthrough in cosmic geometry led to detailed studies of eclipse mechanics. The superstar was Isaac Newton — the towering genius who in 1687   with his law of gravitational attraction. His breakthrough made it possible to predict the exact paths of not only comets and planets but the sun, the moon and the Earth. As a result, eclipse forecasts soared in precision. Newton’s good friend, Edmond Halley, who lent his name to a bright comet, put the new powers on public display. In 1714, he   showing the predicted path of a solar eclipse across England in the next year. Halley asked observers to determine the totality’s actual scope. Scholars   history’s first wide study of a solar eclipse. In accuracy, his predictions   those of the Astronomer Royal, who  y on astronomical matters. Today’s specialists, using Newton’s laws and banks of powerful computers,   the movements of stars for millions of years in advance. But closer to home, they have difficulty making eclipse predictions over such long periods of time. That’s because the Earth, the moon and the sun lie in relative proximity and thus exert comparatively strong gravitational tugs on one another that change subtly in strength over the eons, slightly altering planetary spins and positions. Despite such complications, “it’s possible to predict eclipse dates more than 10,000 years into the future,” Dr. Espenak, the former NASA expert, said in an interview. He created the space agency’s   that list solar eclipses to come — including some   from now. So, if you’re enthusiastic about the April 8 totality, you might consider what’s in store for whoever is living in what we today call Madagascar on Aug. 12, 5814. According to Dr. Espenak, that date will feature the phenomenon of day turning into night and back again into day — a spectacle of nature, not of malevolent gods.

Now, Carbondale and its neighbors are getting ready for another day with no sun. While towns in the area averaged around two and half minutes in the darkness of totality in 2017, this time they will experience about four minutes of totality. Preparation and hype have increased, too. Mr. Baer first heard that Carbondale, five hours south of Chicago, was in the crossroads of two solar eclipses nearly a decade before the 2017 event. But the significance didn’t click for him until 2014, when an astronomer from the National Solar Observatory reached out. “Once I understood, I about fell out my chair,” Mr. Baer said, though he struggled to convince anyone else. “When I started talking to people about the eclipse, their eyes would gloss over. I’d lose them in the first 20 seconds.” That started to change as August 2017 got closer. Carbondale, which planned for that eclipse for three years, welcomed around 14,000 people.

Seventy miles away, city officials in Paducah, Ky., were surprised by the number of visitors they got. “We had no idea what to expect,” said Angela Schade, a downtown development specialist in Paducah’s planning department. She remembers locals renting out their yards to campers in an attempt to make room for everyone coming for the eclipse. Ms. Schade watched the spectacle from the parking lot at work but didn’t fully comprehend what she was experiencing.

But according to Ms. Dunn, interest in the eclipse seems higher than it was in 2017. “All our neighboring communities have got all these things planned,” she said, adding that last time Carbondale was the only place in southern Illinois that did anything big. Events aren’t limited to the day of the eclipse — communities are planning festivities for the weekend before and the evening after totality. Part of this is strategic: Makanda is hosting a dance on the night of April 8, for example, in the hopes of mitigating the kind of post-eclipse traffic jams that paralyzed the town in 2017.

In 2017, the event coincided with the first day of classes, so the university rolled it into the orientation activities. On April 8, classes will be canceled for a schoolwide block party. Many students will assist NASA-funded research projects. After that, it won’t be until 2045 that a total solar eclipse comes anywhere near this region lucky enough to see two in seven years. “For many of the people that are going to see it, it is a once-in-a-lifetime event,” Dr. Skinner said.

In 2017, the event coincided with the first day of classes, so the university rolled it into the orientation activities. On April 8, classes will be canceled for a schoolwide block party. Many students will assist NASA-funded research projects. After that, it won’t be until 2045 that a total solar eclipse comes anywhere near this region lucky enough to see two in seven years. “For many of the people that are going to see it, it is a once-in-a-lifetime event,” Dr. Skinner said.

No Eclipse Plans? Try These Last-Minute Strategies.,"Advertisement Supported by On April 8, parts of 13 U.S. states, Mexico and Canada will plunge into midday darkness. Miss this spectacle and you’ll have to wait till 2044 for the next one so close to home. This article is part of The Times’s coverage of the  , the last time a total solar eclipse will be visible in most of North America for 20 years. On April 8, a total solar eclipse will blot out the sun for roughly 4,200 miles stretching from Mexico to Canada — a cosmic show that so much of North America won’t see again for about 20 years. Many made their   well in advance. And then there are the procrastinators, who just realized they’re about to miss out. If that’s you, you’ve still got options, but not as many. “At this point, your goal is just to get to the path of totality and see the eclipse for the longest possible time,” said Melanie Fish, the head of global public relations for  . “You’re not trying to find the best party. You’re not trying to make it into your dream vacation. You just want to get to the path of totality.” So first, get your hands on some   so you can  . Then find a way to get yourself into the path of totality, the strip running across 13 states where the moon will fully eclipse the sun. You’ll be competing with people who have already   for flights and accommodations, so be ready to pay more. And take off the next day, too, if you can. Otherwise, you may spend hours caught in traffic, as many discovered after the  . Here are four strategies for a last-minute foray into the total-eclipse zone.

You might even find relatively inexpensive accommodations just outside the zone, and then drive in from there. But if you’re hoping to rent a car, you might have some trouble. The rental car company Hertz reported a 3,000 percent increase in advanced bookings for car rentals in cities along the eclipse path compared with the previous year. The highest demand so far has come in places like Dallas and Austin, Texas, as well as Cleveland and Indianapolis. If you want to try anyway, book your car as soon as possible and focus your search for rental agencies outside of high-volume areas like airports, advised Isabella Sawyer, a   spokeswoman. Neighborhood locations, she said, may have better availability. Whether you rent or own your ride, be prepared for gridlock. “People arrive at different times, but everybody leaves at the same time — and that’s the problem,” said Aixa Diaz, an   spokeswoman. “Let’s say you have about five million people looking at an eclipse, and  . That’s like the equivalent of 71 sold-out football games all getting out at the same time.” Taking off the extra day could help you avoid traffic. Data from the 2017 total eclipse, which also took place on a Monday, showed about 41 percent less traffic leaving destinations on Tuesday, compared with Monday, Ms. Diaz said. You could also book a last-minute flight to a city in the path of the total eclipse, preferably one where you won’t need a car. Searches for flights along the eclipse path have quadrupled compared with the same time last year, said Katy Nastro, a spokeswoman at  . “What is unique about this event is that people are not bound to fly to just one place to be able to experience the eclipse,” she said, “which means they can look at multiple cities in the path, or even cities near the path,” and then, provided you can find a rental car in your destination, drive into the path. “For example, you could fly into and stay in Toronto, then drive to the border to view the eclipse from the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, just a two-and-a-half-hour drive away,” Ms. Nastro said. (As of Wednesday, Toronto’s main airport still had rental cars available, starting at about $40 a day.) The   crosses not only small towns but also plenty of hotel-rich urban areas stretching from Texas through the Midwest and upstate New York — places like Dallas-Fort Worth, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y., and Montreal. But even in cities with more available rooms, you’ll still most likely have to pay a premium. “I saw a two-star apartment hotel in Nashville going for $900 all in,” Ms. Fish said of one of the accommodations she found (Nashville is a couple of hours’ drive outside the total-eclipse path), “and a Super 8 in Indianapolis going for $500 the night of the eclipse. So if you’re booking last minute to go see the eclipse, yeah, you are going to pay more.” Packaging a flight and accommodations on a travel booking app could help save money, as well as headaches, Ms. Fish said. But don’t forget that you may need some sort of ground transportation, so look for packages that include it. If you’re set on traveling to an area where there are fewer hotels, consider a short-term property rental. As of March 20, Airbnb, which has experienced a 1,000 percent  , still had about 40 percent of its inventory available in that zone, according to Haven Thorn, an Airbnb spokesman. Clouds are the eclipse chaser’s nemesis. You can pick a place with the highest likelihood of   and check the forecast obsessively, but the weather is fickle. If you’re driving, be prepared to take a detour at the last minute. And when the big moment nears, pull over safely in a park or a parking lot — not on the side of the road — turn off your car and prepare to be dazzled. Even if you decide not to go anywhere at all, you may still be able to break out those glasses and feel some of the accompanying environmental changes.

"Eclipses Injured Their Eyes, and the World Never Looked the Same","Advertisement Supported by A number of case studies published after recent total solar eclipses highlight the importance of safe viewing. This article is part of The Times’s coverage of the  , the last time a total solar eclipse will be visible in most of North America for 20 years.  visited New York Eye & Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai Hospital shortly after the eclipse of Aug. 21, 2017. She told Dr. Avnish Deobhakta, an ophthalmologist, that she had a black area in her vision, and then drew a crescent shape for him on a piece of paper. When Dr. Deobhakta examined her eyes, he was astonished. He saw a burn on her retina that was exactly the same shape. It was “almost like a branding,” he said. She had looked at the sun during the eclipse without any protection. The burn was an image of the sun’s outer edge. With every eclipse, ophthalmologists see patients who looked at the sun and complain afterward that their vision is distorted: They see small black spots, their eyes are watery and sensitive to light. Usually, the symptoms resolve, although it may take several weeks to a year. But the woman’s retinal burns, which Dr. Deobhakta and colleagues described in a medical case write-up, would not heal. Her retina was permanently scarred and a sign of the severity of injuries that can follow looking at an eclipse without proper precautions. With the coming eclipse in April, ophthalmologists advise people to be careful and not assume that short glances at the sun are safe. Damage can occur, they say, in less than a minute. David Calkins, director of the Vanderbilt Vision Research Center and vice chair of the Vanderbilt Eye Institute in Nashville, said younger people were   of retinal injury, possibly because the lens of their eye is clearer than the lens in older people. He said they also may be a bit more reckless. But age is no guarantee of safe eclipse viewing. A study   aged 15 to 82 in England who complained of symptoms like black spots in their vision or blurry vision after an eclipse in 1999. Four said they used eclipse glasses; one said she used sunglasses. The rest looked with naked eyes. Five had visible damage to their retinas. All but four of the 20 were better after seven months. Not everyone is so lucky. A study   last year involved four young Irish women who   during a religious gathering  . The women, who did not know one another, sought medical attention within a few days of looking at the sun. They complained of blind spots in the center of their vision and said objects appeared distorted and blurred. Investigators from Galway University Hospital followed up with the women for an average of more than five years. One was followed for 11 years. Years later, the researchers reported, all of the women still had the blind spots. For Dr. Deobhakta, the situation with the woman in 2017 is a cautionary tale. While she did put on protective glasses for part of her viewing of the eclipse, she at first looked at it several times for about six seconds each time without protection. She felt fine for four hours. Then her symptoms emerged: blurred vision, distorted shapes and colors, and that crescent-shaped black spot in the center of her vision with her left eye. Most people look at an eclipse through special eclipse glasses. Often the glasses have a cardboard body with special film in the eyeholes that filters out harmful rays. Dr. Deobhakta said he did not trust many of the eclipse glasses being sold and felt it was not worth taking a chance on them. He prefers an   that involves using pinholes, like in a colander, to cast the sun’s shadow on the ground. Professional groups say many eclipse glasses are safe but urge caution when buying them. The American Astronomical Society reported that   flooded the market before the 2017 eclipse. To help people find eclipse glasses, the astronomical society   and distributors. Legitimate eclipse glasses must meet specific international safety standards known as ISO 12312-2. Testing requires a spectrophotometer that measures how much ultraviolet, visible and infrared light gets through the glasses. But an ISO logo on the glasses is not necessarily an assurance, the astronomical society warns, because dealers can — and some do — snatch an ISO logo from the internet and put it on their glasses. Rick Fienberg, project manager of the astronomical society’s Solar Eclipse Task Force, said counterfeiting companies were also putting the names of legitimate distributors on their products. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unsafe, he added. But it does mean that the seller, or the company that sold it the products, is committing fraud. Dr. Fienberg suggests buying directly from a seller on the astronomical society’s list. But, he said, if you are worried about your glasses, there is a way to see if they are effective. Look around a room with the eclipse glasses on. The glasses should be so dark you can’t see anything. Then, go outside and glance at the sun with the glasses on. You probably are safe, he said, if you can see the sun through the lenses and “the image is sharp and comfortably bright.” Dr. Deobhakta still worries. He says he knows he is overly cautious but can’t help warning people about the coming eclipse. “Do not look at it whether you have glasses or not,” he said. “I’m not going to let my family members look at it. I’m a doctor. That’s why I say what I say. I saw what happened.” An earlier version of this article, using information from a doctor, misstated the source of a woman’s eye injury.

"Consumers Hate ‘Price Discrimination,’ but They Sure Love a Discount","Advertisement Supported by The Wendy’s debacle is a warning shot for brands: If you want to play with prices, make sure to communicate why and whom it could help. It’s been a strange and maddening couple of years for consumers, with prices of essential goods soaring and then sinking, turning household budgets upside down.  in the New York Times Audio app on iOS. Perhaps that’s why, in late February, the internet revolted over Wendy’s plan to test  . If the Breakfast Baconator winds up costing $6.99 at 7 a.m. and $7.99 three hours later, what in life can you really count on anymore? The company   saying it would not raise prices during busy parts of the day, but rather add discounts during slower hours. Nevertheless, the episode won’t stop the continued spread of so-called dynamic pricing, which describes an approach of setting prices in response to shifting patterns of demand and supply. It might not even stop the growth of “personalized pricing,” which targets individuals based on their personal willingness to pay. And in many circumstances, customers may come around — if they feel companies are being forthright about how they’re changing prices and what information they’re using to do it. “There’s a need for some transparency, and it has to make sense to consumers,” said Craig Zawada, a pricing expert with PROS, a consultancy that helped pioneer dynamic pricing by airlines in the 1980s and now works across dozens of other industries. “In general, from a buyer standpoint, there has to be this perception of fairness.” Dynamic pricing, by one name or another, has been around since the dawn of merchandising. Sometimes it’s a means of maximizing return on fixed expenses, such as labor: Happy hour is a way to boost bar traffic before the after-work rush, for example. (You might say Wendy’s was attempting a happy hour for Baconators.) “Load balancing” is a similar concept in energy and transportation. Utilities charge less for power overnight, and transit agencies impose higher fares during rush hour to encourage users to shift toward off-peak times, when energy and trains are in less demand. Other times, it’s an effort to liquidate perishable or seasonal goods, like fresh produce at a grocery store or winter coats at Macy’s. Then there’s “surge pricing” on ride-hailing platforms, which is meant to quickly prod more drivers to start picking up passengers. Some commodity goods, like gasoline, fluctuate daily with international markets. In the analog era, changing prices was costly, requiring manually updating signs or applying markdown stickers. As restaurants, retailers, parking garages, gyms, salons and event venues became more automated, price changes became effortless even at brick-and-mortar locations. Robert Orndorff is the vice president for product development at Spectrio, which makes digital signage — a key tool for smoothly adjusting price levels, and increasingly common in many industries. Signs can be connected to inventory systems that automatically adjust prices as supplies dwindle, for example, and changes can be rolled out quickly in response to competitors’ moves. “You have all these dynamic things going on that would make you want to change what’s on that screen at any given time,” Mr. Orndorff said. “The technology absolutely enables all that.” It’s easy to understand why companies want to change prices more frequently: to make more money. But does that mean that as dynamic pricing spreads, prices will be higher on average? Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio,   to the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, at an oversight hearing in March, calling the technique “just another way for corporations to make it harder for consumers to seek out lower prices.” “Are you concerned that the wide adoption of these pricing schemes, if you will, contribute to inflation?” Mr. Brown asked. Mr. Powell responded that dynamic pricing lowers prices as well as raises them, and that the overall impact on price levels isn’t yet known. Part of the concern comes from the idea that dynamic pricing is often enabled by algorithms, which are opaque to consumers and regulators, and can be tools of collusion. The Federal Trade Commission recently   warning that price fixing by algorithms is still illegal, even without explicit human direction. And when one company dominates the market, dynamic pricing is more likely to inflate prices overall. But in a competitive environment, dynamic pricing can also lead to price wars that benefit consumers. Most companies use the strategy to try to broaden their reach, according to pricing experts, increasing their revenues by bringing in new customers rather than making more money on each one. In   of a large restaurant chain that used an algorithm to vary prices for food delivery, diners reacted strongly, smoothing out orders across the day and enabling the company to bring in more revenue even as it lowered prices on average. Or take airlines: Lowering fares far in advance allows more price-sensitive, date-flexible leisure travelers to afford the trip, while business travelers pay much more for last-minute tickets. Those decisions can be increasingly targeted, since companies have vast troves of data about their customers, and direct connections with them through smartphone apps. Jean-Pierre Dubé is a professor of marketing at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business who has studied personalized pricing. In one experiment, two movie theaters offered mobile discounts to people who were located closer to their competitor, effectively creating a two-tier price structure. (This is common with senior and student discounts.) In the end, both moviegoers and theaters came out ahead. “When both firms do it, the prices go down a ton,” Dr. Dubé said. “The only reason the firms aren’t harmed profit-wise is that you can generate enough new customers who wouldn’t have otherwise gone to a movie to make up for it.” If companies did this more often, they might end up charging wealthier people more, effectively creating a progressive cost structure for goods and services. For example, a 2017 economics paper   grocery stores could make more money by offering lower prices in poor neighborhoods, which they currently tend not to do. It’s also clearly legal: The Federal Trade Commission   that “absent unfair and deceptive conduct,” personalized pricing itself provides “no basis for intervention.” But few companies have embraced the strategy, fearing the kind of fury that Wendy’s faced — or, at least, don’t charge different sticker prices for different people, which draws accusations of the uglier term “price discrimination.” Instead, they’ve found more subtle ways to personalize the shopping experience that create essentially the same result. Zohar Gilad runs Fast Simon, a company that helps retailers optimize their websites. Instead of offering different prices, they might display higher-end items for customers with a free-spending buying history, and clearance items for bargain hunters. Targeted coupons for hesitant browsers also create a personalized price by another name, creating a sale that might not have happened. “Say if you search for something and you didn’t buy it, you may get an email saying: ‘Hey, you have great taste. We saw you looking for black boots. Here’s a 20 percent coupon,’” Mr. Gilad said. “I think that personalization, done correctly, can be good and serve both shoppers and the merchants well.” Nonetheless, some retailers prefer the loyalty that can stem from stable prices, even if it means forgoing short-term profits. Walmart, with its Every Day Low Prices approach, eschews coupons and rarely discounts anything. The practice “helps us earn trust with our customers, because they don’t have to chase sales and can count on us to consistently offer everyday low prices,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman. Retailers also must take care to avoid the appearance of discrimination. The Princeton Review came under scrutiny when ProPublica   that because it charged higher rates for test preparation in certain ZIP codes, Asian American students tended to pay more than other groups.

"As Gen X-ers Inch Toward Retirement, They’re Considering Where to Live","Advertisement Supported by retiring The oldest members of Generation X are several years from stopping work, but some are already seeking homes that will suit their later years. When they were raising their four children, Billy and Erin Shipley had space for their family to grow: a two-story, five-bedroom house in Sugar Land, Texas, with a large yard and a pool. But as the children became adults and moved out, the second floor was deserted and maintaining the lawn and pool became a burden. Like many members of Generation X facing an empty nest, the Shipleys decided to look for a home better suited to their needs where they could eventually live in retirement. They chose a three-bedroom, single-story house in Bridgeland, a planned community about 35 miles away. “I did not look at it as a temporary exercise,” Mrs. Shipley, 46, said. “We could live here forever.” Mr. Shipley, 54, added that the single story was a draw. “It’s going to be great not having to walk up stairs later,” he said. Gen X is typically defined as those born between 1965 and 1980. Its oldest members are several years away from retirement, but they are already starting to think about where they will live in their 70s, 80s and even 90s.  The desire to grow older in one’s own home — rather than having to move in with family or to a retirement home — is common among many generations. In 2021, 88 percent of older adults, defined as people at least 65 years old, lived in their own home, according to   from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. “Overall demand is for maintaining quality of life as you age,” said Joanna Frank, chief executive and president of the Center for Active Design, a nonprofit organization that developed the   standard used by architects, designers and developers to foster wellness at home and in the workplace. But home builders say they are starting to see rising demand among Gen X-ers for homes they can age into. “We are at the cusp,” said David O’Reilly, the chief executive of Howard Hughes Holdings, which builds planned communities, including Bridgeland in Texas. Many Gen X-ers still have children at home, he said, but they will soon be empty nesters. “That’s normally the tipping point,” he added. Those who can afford it are willing to pay for extra space in case they need to take care of other family members, like grandchildren, adult children and aging parents — and in many cases, they already are. In new developments, they are seeking access to health and wellness amenities, like hiking trails and tennis courts, as well as opting for home features like showers instead of bathtubs, for instance, and asking for the latest gadgets to help them as they age. “They have more market power than younger buyers,” said Jennifer Molinsky, director of the Housing an Aging Society Program at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. “They have a lot of wealth and are ready to make changes.” With a median income of $126,900, members of Gen X are still amassing wealth, according to a report released Wednesday by the  , or NAR, a trade group. “They are in their peak earning years” said Jessica Lautz, the group’s deputy chief economist and vice president of research. They are also sitting on a pile of home equity. Homeownership among Gen X-ers was 72 percent in 2023, which was significantly higher than for millennials, at 55 percent, according to  , a real estate services company. Another factor prompting Gen X to consider moving sooner to purchase a home for their retirement years is the  , which was stuck in a deep freeze for most of 2023 as high interest rates kept many buyers and sellers on the sidelines. Home prices rose 6 percent in January from the same month a year ago, according to the  , and many potential buyers worry that prices will continue to soar, hampering their ability to afford a home later. “If they are shopping for homes, given the tightness of the market and remote work, I do believe you see more Gen X-ers seeing a home purchase as a home for the rest of their lives,” said Cristian deRitis, deputy chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. They are not necessarily trading down in terms of space or quality, he added. In fact, some may be looking to trade up, especially if they are buying what will be their last home. “‘This is my 30-year home, not my five-year home,’” he said. Many members of Gen X find themselves in the sandwich generation, or simultaneously supporting children (some of whom are adults themselves) and parents. To manage caregiving, some home buyers are choosing three- and four-bedroom homes to accommodate their multigenerational households. “It’s a stubborn trend; it’s not a flash in the pan,” said Dr. Lautz, the economist at NAR, which found that 19 percent of Gen X-ers who bought a home in 2023 purchased a multigenerational home. “Gen X-ers seem to be caring for parents and having younger adults boomeranging back into their homes.” Now that their children are grown and have moved out, the Shipleys in Texas have to care only for their labradoodle, Clyde, but having three bedrooms means they can accommodate family if necessary. “We want our kids to come back and have a place to sleep when they visit,” said Mr. Shipley, who added that he and his wife have room for their parents, who are in their 70s and may have to live with them someday. GL Homes, a developer in Sunrise, Fla., with a dozen planned communities in the state, has noticed a shift in demand, the company’s president, Misha Ezratti, said. “People are moving to their forever home a little earlier,” he said. “You would think they would downsize, but after the pandemic, they still need the space.” GL Homes has responded by designing floor plans that cater to Gen X-ers, including Melissa Radin, a career coach in Livingston, N.J., who owns several rental properties in Florida. When she found out recently that her real estate investments had doubled in value, she and her husband, Michael, decided to buy their retirement home now. “I wasn’t going to buy a house this early, but I know I would have to pay more, so I jumped,” said Ms. Radin, 57. She scooped up a three-bedroom house in a community developed by GL Homes in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Thinking ahead to a time when their bodies might not work as well, Gen X-ers are asking for features like raised electrical outlets and toilets with higher seats. “I requested custom pullouts because I don’t want to bend to open a cabinet,” Ms. Radin said. She wanted a shower in the primary bathroom, but made a concession for younger family members. “I’m going to have grandchildren, and I need a bathtub in the house,” she said. Part of the customization also includes incorporating technology to help people as they age, like sensors in floorboards that can tell if someone has fallen and even send alerts for help, said Ms. Frank of the Center for Active Design. “Developers are aware that this generation is health conscious and much more tech savvy,” she said. Frank C. Parker III, a certified financial planner for Wells Fargo Advisors in Cincinnati, said he and his wife, Mika, sought a state-of-the-art setup for their retirement home in Boca Raton, Fla., to help them regulate lights, music and a security alarm. “We wanted a smart home that we could control from phones and apps and the wall,” Mr. Parker, 49, said. He added that the Florida lifestyle was also a draw. “We are tennis players,” he said. “We like the beach, the ocean and the pool.” Others say they want to stay healthy as they approach retirement. Mr. Shipley said he and his wife liked to stay fit, and Bridgeland had amenities like pools, biking trails and fitness classes within walking distance. GL Homes is adding more amenities for active adults, including a cold plunge tub and pickleball courts. “We did not expect fitness to be such a big thing,” Mr. Ezratti said.  covers breaking news and real estate and is the editor of the   column.

Help Ukraine Hold the Line,"Advertisement Supported by The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding . It is separate from the newsroom. After more than two years of brutal, unrelenting war, Ukraine is still ready and has the capacity to defend its democracy and territory against Russia. But it cannot do so without American military assistance, which the United States had assured the Ukrainians would be there as long as it was needed. A majority of Americans understand this, and believe that curbing the revanchist dreams of Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, is America’s duty to Ukraine and to American security. A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Ipsos found that   favor providing economic help to Ukraine and sending more arms and military equipment to the Ukrainian government. And 60 percent of respondents said that the U.S. security relationship with Ukraine does more to strengthen American national security than to weaken it. While that support has declined somewhat since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, and it is weaker among Republicans, many Republican members of Congress also support continuing military aid. So it is distressing that the fate of Ukraine has fallen prey to internecine Republican politicking. House Speaker Mike Johnson has the power to do the right thing, but time is running critically short. Without American artillery, as well as antitank and antiaircraft shells and missiles, Ukraine cannot hold off an army that has a far deeper supply of men and munitions. “Russia is now firing at least five times as many artillery rounds as Ukraine,” as Andrew Kramer of The Times  . As summer approaches, Russia is expected to prepare a new offensive thrust. Mr. Johnson knows this. He also knows that, if he brings it to a vote, a   would most likely sail through the House with bipartisan support. Many Republican members and most Democrats want to pass it. The Senate passed it in February. Yet so far, Mr. Johnson has avoided a vote, fearing that a clutch of far-right House members, who parrot the views of Donald Trump and oppose any more aid for Ukraine, could topple him from the speaker’s post. To placate them, the speaker has said he will produce a proposal with “important innovations” when legislators return to work on Tuesday. These may include lifting the Biden administration’s hold on liquefied natural gas exports, including a proposed terminal in his home state, Louisiana; calling the aid a loan; or seizing billions of frozen Russian assets. None of those conditions are wise. Tying aid for Ukraine to unrelated political goals, such as undoing President Biden’s climate change agenda, may be typical of congressional horse trading, but it turns Ukraine into a pawn in partisan conflict. “This is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,” Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, said on his visit to Washington last month. The speaker’s decision, he said, “will really cost thousands of lives there — children, women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.” Nor does it make sense to force Ukraine to take on massive debt when it’s fighting for its life, and its economy is already dependent on aid. Seizing large sums of money from another sovereign nation could also have unpredictable legal and economic consequences. Given Ukraine’s perilous position, however, most Democrats and Republicans would likely accept what Mr. Johnson cobbles together, even measures they have reservations about, particularly since the package also includes aid for Israel and Taiwan. Those lawmakers are right to pursue a reasonable compromise. The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has also   Mr. Johnson as speaker to avoid yet another damaging and pointless fight over the speakership. Those moves are welcome steps to try to loosen the grip of Republican extremists on America’s ability to support its allies. Of course, recalcitrance in Congress is not Ukraine’s only problem. Europe has been slow to step in to meet Ukraine’s military needs, and the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, may have taken too long to lower the recruitment age to 25 in the face of a shortage of soldiers. But American weapons and artillery are essential to Ukraine’s ability to hold the line and, eventually, to negotiate for an end to hostilities from a position of strength. No country has the stockpiles or the production capabilities to match the United States in producing and providing the 155-millimeter artillery shells, HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) or air defense systems that Ukraine requires to hold the Russians at bay. Russia, by contrast, has successfully ramped up military production and is receiving supplies from North Korea and Iran, and Mr. Putin has used the recent terror attack on a   to ramp up recruitment. Ukraine is already suffering the consequences of America’s faltering support. Russian forces  , and U.S. intelligence officials   Congress that this happened because Ukraine ran out of artillery shells. The Russian command is doubtlessly aware of this as it plans its next moves. Mr. Putin gambled from the outset that the United States would not go the distance in its support for Ukraine, and he must be reveling in the goings-on in Congress. Allowing Russia to impose its will on Ukraine would be a devastating blow to America’s credibility and leadership — fulfilling one of Mr. Putin’s long-term goals. That, in turn, would risk encouraging him to test waters further afield, whether in the Baltic States, in western Europe or to the south, and would signal to Xi Jinping that China, too, can throw its weight around. Mr. Trump and his followers may argue that the security of Ukraine, or even of Europe, is not America’s business. But the consequence of allowing a Russian victory in Ukraine is a world in which authoritarian strongmen feel free to crush dissent or seize territory with impunity. That is a threat to the security of America, and the world. Congress is prepared to stand up to this aggression; it is Mr. Johnson’s duty to bring this effort to a vote.

It is separate from the newsroom. After more than two years of brutal, unrelenting war, Ukraine is still ready and has the capacity to defend its democracy and territory against Russia. But it cannot do so without American military assistance, which the United States had assured the Ukrainians would be there as long as it was needed. A majority of Americans understand this, and believe that curbing the revanchist dreams of Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, is America’s duty to Ukraine and to American security. A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Ipsos found that   favor providing economic help to Ukraine and sending more arms and military equipment to the Ukrainian government. And 60 percent of respondents said that the U.S. security relationship with Ukraine does more to strengthen American national security than to weaken it. While that support has declined somewhat since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, and it is weaker among Republicans, many Republican members of Congress also support continuing military aid. So it is distressing that the fate of Ukraine has fallen prey to internecine Republican politicking. House Speaker Mike Johnson has the power to do the right thing, but time is running critically short. Without American artillery, as well as antitank and antiaircraft shells and missiles, Ukraine cannot hold off an army that has a far deeper supply of men and munitions. “Russia is now firing at least five times as many artillery rounds as Ukraine,” as Andrew Kramer of The Times  .
